<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DEPARTURE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ambrose Thompson</span> opened his front door
and looked out. It was May, the sun had just
risen over Pennyroyal, and before him lay Kentucky's
carnival of spring.</p>

<p>The boy drew a deep breath that seemed to
rise and quiver over his face like a breeze coming
away at the end of his long, curiously emotional
nose.</p>

<p>"Glory, what a day!" he whispered; "seems
about good enough to eat!" And then he vanished,
only to reappear five minutes afterward
dressed as a traveller and wearing a linen duster,
a stovepipe hat, and carrying a carpet-bag.</p>

<p>Out in the cinder path his glance embraced
the quiet street.</p>

<p>"Right foot, left foot"&mdash;without a change of
expression the boy broke into an irrepressible
jig. He was nineteen and stood six feet four in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his stocking feet; the wind tilted his tall hat,
showing his high forehead, his straight, straw-coloured
hair, and solemn, light blue eyes; it
whipped back his linen duster, disclosing his
lean legs clad in tight trousers, his frock coat,
and white stock. An indescribable air of adventure
enveloped him. So Abraham Lincoln
may have looked on some dress-occasion morning
in his youth&mdash;all big bones and promises
waiting for something to happen.</p>

<p>"I sure am going to give 'em the slip this
time," Ambrose panted, stopping to readjust his
costume and to take another careful survey of
the neighbourhood. In his garden several lilac
bushes were in their first bloom, and above his
doorway an ardent, over-early honeysuckle had
blossomed in the night. The young man put
the honeysuckle in his buttonhole.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Leaping ditches, tearing across ploughed fields, to the woods ahead&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I reckon," he remarked, "there ain't nothin'
sweet that don't grow in Kentucky," and
then with a smile whose shine radiated through
his homeliness and a blush that spread to
the tips of his big ears, he added: "I ain't
just figurin' on the growth of flowers," and
was off tiptoeing down his garden walk and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
stepping across his gate to avoid the creak of
opening it.</p>

<p>This was fifty-five years ago in Kentucky,
in a little village of some three or four hundred
inhabitants, shut in by hills and by inclination
in the southwestern part of the state; a community
not to be confounded with their high-living,
high-stepping blue grass neighbours, for dwellers
in the "Pennyrile" were a plainer people, who
perhaps drew some of their characteristics from
the bittersweet, pungent "Pennyrile" grass that
gave the locality its name.</p>

<p>As for the town itself, it rested primly in a cup-shaped
hollow with three main streets. One of
them, travelling farther than the rest, led in a
way to the end of things for the residents of
Pennyroyal as it climbed a hill at the foot of the
village, set thick with hardy perennials, evergreens,
and small white stones, while encircling
this hill was Peter's Creek, that by and by grew
up to be a river, but it had a tranquil movement,
proceeding slowly on its course by reason
of sharing the Pennyroyalian distaste for getting
any distance from home.</p>

<p>Then the houses in Pennyroyal: although the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
beautiful open country was all about them,
they crowded so close together that they seemed
almost to touch elbows, and now and then one
of them had appeared to shove the other back
in its determination to get the best view of the
street. They were mostly cottages, with no
front porches, but with sloping roofs and little
Gothic wooden fences, and painted white, with
green outside blinds, except Ambrose's, and his
had been touched with a boy's imagination, its
intention being plainly rose colour.</p>

<p>Now in a double row along the outside wooden
sidewalk this morning the linden trees were dropping
fragrant yellow plumes inches deep in the
ruts of the clay road, while over the chimneys
whirled the last of the spring's apple blossoms.
Bees buzzed among the flowers, birds chattered,
flying nervously from one tree to another in an
effort to be through with breakfast before the disturbing
human element should get about; and
hitched to a nearby post Ambrose's horse and
gig were waiting.</p>

<p>The young man surveyed his equipage with
the eyes of an idealist.</p>

<p>Old Liza had seen service, but her toilet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
had been made in the spirit of the best foot foremost;
her coat had been freshly curried, her
gray mane and tail carefully combed, and in
her manner there was an air of emotional anticipation.</p>

<p>With one foot hovering above the step of his
gig, Ambrose suddenly paused. The laprobe
inside the carriage was quivering.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" Reaching underneath, the
young man drew forth a small black and brown
object whose legs and tail were five upturned
points of supplication. Setting it upright on
the ground, his face hardened. "Ain't I told
you you couldn't come with me, Moses?" he
began sternly. "Ef ever there was a crittur,
human or otherwise, with a talent for bein'
where it wasn't wanted, it's you! Besides,
ain't I just locked you in the stable?"</p>

<p>The softening in his master's manner, visible
in his last question, in the twitching of his eyebrows,
in the slight movement of the tip of his
long nose, was familiar to Moses. Casually he
approached Ambrose's leg, but midway there,
sensing defeat and not being an amiable beast,
he planted his feet wide apart, barked as loudly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as chronic hoarseness permitted, and straightway
the young man humbled himself before
him.</p>

<p>"Fer the lands sakes don't give me away,"
he pleaded. "I ain't never had such luck before
this, getting off without being pestered."
Down on his knees, he patted the stiff bristles,
apologetically whispering: "Sorry not to be
wishing your company, but Susan and Aunt
Ca'line will look after you. Ain't nothin' on God's
earth that will keep Susan Barrows from lookin'
after every mortal thing she sets eyes on."</p>

<p>Without deigning a farewell, Moses trotted
away. A ridiculous looking animal with an
ancestry as mixed as any son of Adam, yet
he had an enormous self-esteem. You see,
though a dog, Moses possessed a self-sustaining
ego, which requires no special ancestry or talents
to uphold it. For there is a vanity that
feeds itself, and many nobler personalities go
down before it. Invariably Ambrose's did.
Merely christened after the Hebrew lawmaker
because of having been found amid some bulrushes,
yet Moses may have felt that the name
carried its anointment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>But now at last the traveller had fairly
started. Swinging into his gig, he arranged his
long legs in a comfortable right-angle triangle,
taking a final hurried glance around him.
"Move on, Liza, faster'n you can, or it's all over
with me," he urged, "for things is lookin' kind of
nervous."</p>

<p>Three times his wagon wheels had revolved in
the clay road when a shutter on the house next
door banged open, and like the explosion of a
gun a child's voice rent the air.</p>

<p>"He's off! I tell you I see him. He's gettin'
away unbeknownst." And a thin, brown
figure hopping out of the window on the grass
ran toward the street, twittering and moving
its head from side to side like an excited bird.
An instant later from the same opening a second
pair of legs protruded&mdash;longer and thinner
than the others, clad in white stockings and
black cloth gaiters. Like the feelers of a beetle
turned over on its back they waved in the air.
And from behind a kind of barrel-shaped opening
came a voice so tragic and compelling that
even old Liza, stopping short, turned an inquiring
eye toward the source of the disturbance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Ambrose, although filled with a boy's
impatience at interruption, the sight was overpowering.
His reins dropped loosely, he stared,
gasped, and then shook with silent laughter.
Susan Barrows was living in the days of hoopskirts,
and now in her effort to slide through the
window had been held fast.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in her time, desire has probably
removed as many mountains as faith, so, notwithstanding
her present difficulty, Susan's gave
her power soon to set herself upright on the
ground, and still with her full rigging to continue
moving toward her goal like a ship with a
full gale behind it.</p>

<p>A thin middle-aged woman, Mrs. Barrows
was, of medium height and of terrific energy.
The drama of her personal existence in a small
town with no outside interests being always insufficient,
Susan had filled in her hunger with
an insatiate appetite for other people's affairs.
Never could her curiosity about her neighbours
be wholly gratified, and yet, like the possessor
of any other great passion, its owner did her
level best to satisfy it.</p>

<p>Out in the road, with one hand she grasped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Ambrose's coat sleeve while the other was unconsciously
raised toward heaven. Two bright
spots of colour burned on her high cheek bones,
her bunches of black corkscrew curls trembled
with eagerness, her eyes challenged.</p>

<p>"Tell me where you be goin' and what you
be a-goin' fer, Ambrose Thompson. It ain't
fair you stealin' off this way each year and nobody
findin' out where or why. Seems like us
bein' neighbours and me seein' to you since your
ma's death, that you might leastways have put
your trust in me."</p>

<p>Removing her hand from his sleeve, Ambrose
patted it gently before returning it to its owner.
"No, ma'am, I ain't goin' to tell you no more
this time than before," he replied. "And I was
hopin' to get off once without remarks."</p>

<p>During this temporary delay the younger
Susan had been industriously pecking and
poking about in the lower part of their neighbour's
gig. Now as the young man moved on
for the second time the child's voice again rang
after him.</p>

<p>"He's goin' courtin'; Ambrose Thompson is
always runnin' after girls! It's Peachy Williams,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
for I seen his leg under his duster, and he's
wearing his Sunday clothes!"</p>

<p>These last words were a triumph of evidence,
but not for a moment would Ambrose look back
nor appear to have heard. A humorous affection
he might feel for the older Susan, but for
the younger his dislike was to last for more than
fifty years. Nevertheless, a little later he did
turn around, and root and branch, the Susans
had vanished, so that even now the news of his
departure was stirring through Pennyroyal as
the wind moves the leaves in a group of closely
planted trees.</p>

<p>Something it is to know when one is beaten.
Swearing a trifle and yet grinning, the boy settled
himself more comfortably in his gig. "Might
as well drive through town now kind of slow,
and give folks a treat," he relented. "Mebbe I
was shirkin' duty in tryin' to sneak off. Pennyrile
ain't to say starvin' for food and clothes, but
she certainly is pinin' for excitement, and who
says that ain't just as bad? Seems like Christian
charity for me to give this town something to
talk about at least once a year."</p>

<p>And truly these yearly spring migrations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
young Ambrose Thompson had aroused more
interest and unrest in Pennyroyal than the yearly
mystery of the earth's rebirth. Because, for the
past five years on a certain May morning (and
there never was a way of discovering just
which morning he might choose) Ambrose had
set out, at first on foot and later with his gig,
and been away from his home eight and forty
hours. Returning, he had given no clue as to
where he had been.</p>

<p>Now like the music of a calliope the squeak
of his wagon wheels awoke the village. Windows
and doors flew open, heads in nightcaps
and bald heads and heads with curls were thrust
forth, but to their volley of questionings and
accusations, Ambrose offered only the morning's
greetings.</p>

<p>Travelling with praiseworthy slowness, he
neglected no street in Pennyroyal, and, by the
dozen, girls went fluttering in and out of houses,
to wave farewells to the adventurer, while
bolder voices called out Peachy Williams's name
with every teasing inflection. One girl to whom
Ambrose threw the spray of honeysuckle from
his buttonhole cast it scornfully back, refusing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to accept what she so plainly thought another's
spoils.</p>

<p>Then the young man drove past Brother
Bibbs, the Baptist minister, who, framed in the
vestibule of his wooden church, beamed upon
him with such heavenly condescension toward
earthly affection that his expression of "Bless
you, my children," was almost equivalent to a
marriage ceremony. Next, along his route,
appeared three maiden sisters, the Misses Polly.
They stood in a line in their front yard, Miss
Zeruiah, the literary one, <i>always</i> in advance, then
Miss Narcissa, instructor in mathematics and
the sciences, and last and humblest because
most useful of the family trio, Miss Jane, the
domestic one. Upon her Ambrose smiled with
especial kindness, remembering certain heart-shaped
cookies presented in early youth, which
even in the form of sweet cakes held a kind of
romantic suggestion. The Mistress Polly were
directors of the "Polly Institute," where Ambrose
and Peachy had started their technical
education at about the same time, and yet this
youthful acquaintance hardly justified the present
arrangement of a love motif. Nevertheless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Ambrose distinctly heard the three ladies
breathing in unison the name of "Peachy" as
he passed them by.</p>

<p>Two hours later, well away from Pennyroyal,
having turned off the high road to a less
frequented lane, the traveller brought old Liza
to her first halt. Then, drawing out a large red
handkerchief, he wiped his moist brow and,
removing his collar, gazed furtively about him.</p>

<p>The glory of his early morning face had departed;
he looked older and almost haggard.</p>

<p>"Ain't it awful, human curiosity!" he murmured.
"Reckon I was most too brave in
tryin' to make things worse, and yet I never
dreamed folks would think I was runnin' after
Peachy Williams this trip. She&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lower and lower Ambrose seemed to be
gradually settling down into his gig, although
finding some trouble in disposing of so great a
length of leg.</p>

<p>Finally he sighed: "Kind of wish I had
brought old Moses along fer comp'ny." For
the boy was feeling that need for companionship
that comes after all mental strain. "But then
Moses ain't like dogs; he's so bothersome he's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
most human&mdash;always either wantin' you to do
something fer him or to set up and take notice
of what he is doin'."</p>

<p>Relapsing into silence after this, which was
soon followed by a more usual and serene state
of mind, the young man shortly after took out
from his duster pocket a withered russet apple
left over from the winter store, and thoughtfully
sunk his teeth in it. Then gradually his
tranquillity deepened, increased by the recollection
of his having just passed through the fire
of the enemy and escaped. Behind him lay the
village of Pennyroyal, suspicious yet still unsatisfied,
and before him the open, empty, springtime
road. At will Liza was cropping wayside
grass: the traveller's hands had let slip the
reins, and sometimes his eyes wandered to
the far-off blue horizon and sometimes dwelt on
the closer beauty of the roadsides, where elderberry,
sumach and Virginia creeper were tangled
in thick hedges, and where young grapevines
hung like silver-green garlands under their fine
coating of May dust.</p>

<p>In a Kentucky landscape, to those who comprehend
it, there is ever a sense of generous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
growth, of nature's yielding herself gladly to
life's eternal purpose. Now dimly this country
boy began to understand the motive in the new
beauties and new fragrances of each returning
spring.</p>

<p>Again the eagerness of the dawn overtook
him; and stiffening, he picked up his reins, starting
off again, when, turning in from an elbow up
the road, Ambrose beheld the one person whom
above all others his desire had been to escape.</p>

<p>The figure was occupying the entire seat of a
buggy, but was driving along apparently so lost
in thought as to seem oblivious of anything or
anybody in his vicinity.</p>

<p>"Morning, Ambrose," Doctor Webb began,
however, as he appeared directly alongside the
other gig, and yet there was nothing either in
his tone or manner to suggest that he thought it
unusual for a young man to be turning his back
upon his natural field of labour at this hour of
the morning to drive off in exactly the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>"Morning," Ambrose returned, warily attempting
to creep past without further conversation.
For if the doctor should open the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
broadside of his humour the secret of his journey
might yet be wrested from him. Nevertheless,
although the older man had stopped
his horse too deliberately to be ignored, he
showed no present desire to ask questions.
Indeed, the usual smile had disappeared from
his kind face, and his deeply lined eyes appeared
anxious and worried. Just such a look Ambrose
had seen while the doctor sat watching by
the bedside of a critically ill patient.</p>

<p>"What troubles you, doctor?" he inquired.</p>

<p>In answer the man leaned across from his
buggy, taking one of Ambrose's lean hands in
his, and, unaccustomed to a touch with such
magnetic power in it, a kind of electric thrill
passed through the susceptible boy.</p>

<p>"It's you I've been troubling about lately, my
son," Doctor Webb answered, "and now it seems
as if Providence had just sent you along for me to
speak to this morning. I've brought you out of
children's diseases, chicken pox, measles and the
like, but I've been seein' symptoms in you lately
that have made me powerful uneasy, 'cause in
this trouble it ain't in my power to help you
through."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Ambrose's tongue was thickening, and his
Adam's apple moving convulsively. "Is the
disease so serious, then?" he whispered, feeling
a hitherto unsuspected though general weakness
creeping over him.</p>

<p>The doctor bowed his great head until his
double, treble chin rested upon his shirt bosom,
concealing his face from view. "Sometimes
it's fatal, my boy," he returned, appearing so
moved that his big voice sounded hoarse and
unnatural. "It's true there's some that gets
over it, but nobody ain't ever <i>quite</i> the same
afterward."</p>

<p>Ambrose was trying to keep his knees from
knocking together. "How have I showed symptoms
of the disease?" he asked.</p>

<p>And Doctor Webb's whole body rocked slowly
back and forth. "My son, you're showin' 'em
uncommon bad this mornin'. I could notice
'em soon as I was ridin' up toward you; your
colour is a-comin' an' a-goin', your eyes is shinin'
unnatural bright, your heart is a-thumpin' too
quick." And here he sighed, so that Ambrose
braced his lean shoulders for the worst, although
his lips were dry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me quick, doctor; ef I kin bear it, what
is it ails me?"</p>

<p>"Puppy love," the doctor shouted, and then
giving his old horse an unexpected cut with his
clean willow switch, off he drove, shaking with
laughter.</p>

<p>"Puppy love!" Twice Ambrose repeated the
words in a stupid fashion, and then his laughter
rang out until it sounded like an echo of
the older man's heavier roar. "Durn it," he
said to himself, "ef that ain't just another way
of sayin' 'Peachy'!"</p>

<p>When finally the traveller entered the shelter
of a certain group of low hills near the Kentucky
river, it was well past the middle of the afternoon,
and there in a hollow he fed and watered
his horse and then lay down behind a tree.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In the</span> mean time, however, Mrs. Barrows
and her offspring had not been idle. Indeed, no
sooner had they become convinced that no information
could be had out of Ambrose than
they both set off at once hurrying across back
lots, the younger preceding her mother like an
outrider, thrusting her head and her news into
every open door.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the mother and daughter
had arrived together at a small house set
midway in the next street, and there, without
even pausing to knock, Mrs. Barrows, pulling at
a side door, entered a dining-room. Seated at
a breakfast table were six girls and one young
man, and immediately the six pairs of inquiring
feminine eyes were upraised toward Susan, although
the solitary male continued the eating
of three large fried eggs in spite of the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that his appearance plainly indicated a bilious
temperament.</p>

<p>"Miner Hobbs, he's gone!" said Susan.
"Got off most without my seein' him, though I
ain't had a good night's rest come this month
of May!"</p>

<p>Obviously this information should have been
regarded as interesting, and yet, except for
a curt nod, Miner apparently had not heard.
From earliest boyhood notwithstanding that two
more unlike fellow creatures could not be imagined,
he and Ambrose Thompson had been
closest friends. For while Ambrose was long
and fair, Miner was considerably below medium
height and dark, with one gloomy,
indestructible curl rising above his already
furrowed brow. Alike only in both being orphans,
Ambrose was untroubled by other ties,
while Miner was guardian to six beautiful blond
sisters, all exceeding him in size and tranquillity.
The drygoods firm of Hobbs &amp; Thompson had
been opened up in Pennyroyal a year before, so
that to-day Ambrose's unexplained disappearance
was not only a failure in personal confidence
but a downright business backsliding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by, Miner arose. Still his fit of
abstraction appeared too deep to have been
pierced from the outside, and yet, sliding past
Mrs. Barrows, he attempted to get out of the
door. However, his visitor sprang upon him.</p>

<p>"You're sneakin' off to try to catch up
with Ambrose," she announced triumphantly.
"Well, the Lord knows I ain't one to want to
hinder you. But I'm thinkin' you won't succeed,
for Ambrose Thompson will lead all of us
that aims to keep up with him a powerful long
journey before ever we are through with him."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, in the following of his partner
Miner Hobbs fully understood that one
must proceed warily; therefore he did not attempt
starting until after Ambrose was well
out of town, and then he rode slowly along
on horseback, never coming into the range of
the other traveller's vision, but trying to keep
his wheel tracks in evidence, and now and then
making inquiries of wayfarers. So that about
an hour after Ambrose's entrance into the
woods his friend came to the same place and
there sought the thicket in which he believed
him to have hidden himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/i-040.jpg" width="249" height="400" alt="&quot;Miner rode slowly along on horseback, now and then making inquiries of wayfarers&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Miner rode slowly along on horseback, now and then making inquiries of wayfarers&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Face downward Ambrose was lying on the
soft earth; but if he felt surprise or anger at
hearing the sound of a horse's hoofs, and later a
human footfall, he made no sign. Flopping
over he merely called, "Hello," keeping his
eyes fixed upon the line of hills on the opposite
bank of the river. His fishing-pole, fastened to
a bush near by, was extended over the water, but
Ambrose's only visible occupation was the chewing
of a blade of "pennyrile" grass.</p>

<p>In contrast, Miner Hobbs appeared fatigued
and harassed.</p>

<p>"I got to find out why you come off to yourself
every year, Ambrose," he began angrily.
"I know you're doin' somethin' you're ashamed
of or you wouldn't be hidin'."</p>

<p>"Wherefore?" smiled the other boy. "Look
here, Miner, we're friends, have been since the
first hour we met, yet I can't see as that gives
you the right to know my business. Friends
has got their places, and in my opinion a man
can tell his friend just what he wants him to
know, no more, and no less, and the friend ain't
the privilege to spy out a single other thing."</p>

<p>"But you're doin' somethin' sinful or you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
would 'a' told me," Miner repeated doggedly,
and then, although uninvited, he sat down on the
ground close by, commencing to smooth out
the Hyperion curl over his brow which his dejection
and the heat of his trip had considerably
tightened.</p>

<p>"Then we'll let it go at that," drawled Ambrose.</p>

<p>And for the next five minutes both boys
sulked, Miner gnawing savagely at his plug of
tobacco, Ambrose still chewing on the blade of
"pennyrile" grass.</p>

<p>There were no informing signs about the place,
so Miner decided that the truant must now
merely be resting on his journey.</p>

<p>"You hadn't a right to run off from business,"
Miner spluttered next. Having made
up his mind not to make this accusation, the
little man was surprised upon hearing it explode
of its own strength.</p>

<p>However, Ambrose, instead of appearing disturbed,
attempted to arrange himself more comfortably
on the grass, but finding this impossible,
his voice suggested richer repose.</p>

<p>"Miner, ain't it ever come to you that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Lord has given human bein's time for more than
one thing?" he queried, resting his chin upon
his hand. "I hold with work myself most
always, but now and then there comes a time,
maybe it's just a short time, that is meant for
something else, something that belongs to you
and is intended for you to do same as your
work. Maybe it's restin' and maybe it ain't."</p>

<p>But at this the little man rose up on his feet.
"As you've made up your mind you are not
goin' to tell me, Ambrose, what is the use of
talkin' so much? I suppose you're sure you
are not goin' to tell me?"</p>

<p>His companion bowed his head.</p>

<p>"All right then, it ain't necessary," Miner
rejoined. "I know what 'tis. There ain't but
one thing that could ever come between you
and me and that's&mdash;a girl. If it ain't Peachy
Williams that has lured you from home, then
it's some one else. I've been expectin' this to
happen a long time, and I've been tryin' to
prepare myself for this day,"&mdash;here Miner
choked, and coughed in order to conceal his
emotion&mdash;"but I've always said to myself:
Ambrose's easy, but he's open, and he'll surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tell me in time to get a brace. Of course I
know, Ambrose, that you've been plumb crazy
about girls since the Lord knows when, and
been sendin' mottoes and valentines since you
were able to talk, but I didn't think you would
reach the marryin' stage fer quite a spell. Still
I can see for myself that this spring trip looks
like business. It passes my knowledge,"&mdash;Miner
relented&mdash;"but it's you. Seems as if I
couldn't bear havin' females worritin' me save
those my parents and the Lord put on me to the
last day I live, but you, Ambrose, you ain't
never had petticoat sense and never will. Good-bye."
And there was unutterable scorn in
Miner's last words, as he moved away, mingled
with the affection he was to feel for no living
thing save Ambrose. When with head bowed,
he was unconsciously treading underfoot the
flowers that sprinkled his path, a fishing-pole
and line deftly circled through the air caught its
hook in his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>The one boy struggled, while the other jerked,
and then a rich voice drawled: "Please come
back, old man, for if you really want to know
why I've run off to myself each spring for these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
past five years so it clean hurts you not to know,
I reckon I've got to tell you."</p>

<p>Then Miner returned and sat down again.
His friend's behaviour was now even more
puzzling than before, for although Ambrose was
close by, his eyes had a faraway look in them,
his eyebrows were twitching, his slender nostrils
quivering, and indeed, he had the appearance of
a man having strayed off some great distance
by himself.</p>

<p>"Swear you'll never give me away, Miner,"
he began, and holding up one of his big hands in
the sunlight&mdash;his hands which were the truly
beautiful thing about him&mdash;he made a mystic
sign to which his companion swore.</p>

<p>"You won't understand when I do tell you,"
he hedged, "but I've been comin' away off to
myself every spring since I was a boy on account
of the 'Second Song of Solomon.'"</p>

<p>And at this Miner groaned, shutting his near-sighted
eyes. "Lord, he's the chap that had a
thousand wives!"</p>

<p>Then back to earth came Ambrose, his blue
eyes swimming in mists of laughter and his
shouts waking all the echoes in the hills.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wives!" he cried, rolling his long body over
and over in the grass, and kicking out his legs in
sheer ecstasy, "Miner Hobbs, if ever you git
an idea fixed in your head, earthquakes won't
shake it. Wives, is it? Why, I ain't given
Peachy Williams a thought of my own accord
since I started on this trip, nor any other girl,
for that matter, so I can't for the land sakes
see why I have been havin' her poked at me so
continual! 'Course there wouldn't be sense
in me denyin' that I have a hankerin' for girls;
flesh and blood, 'ceptin' yours, Miner Hobbs,
cannot deny the kind we raise in Kentucky.
However, they ain't been on my mind this trip.
Old King Solomon done a lot of things besides
havin' a thousand wives&mdash;they was his recreation.
He builded a temple and founded a nation
and wrote pretty nigh the greatest poetry
heard in these parts."</p>

<p>Here the speaker commenced pulling at the
damp earth to hide his embarrassment, and then
made a pretence of examining the soil that came
up in his hand.</p>

<p>"It's the 'Second Song of Solomon' I'm meanin',
Miner, and I've already told you you ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
goin' to comprehend me when I do explain," he
continued patiently, "but bein's as it's you, I
reckon I've got to try. It's that song about
spring. Ever since I was a little boy and first
heard it, why it began a-callin' me to get away
for a little space to myself to try and kind of
hear things grow. It's a disappointin' reason
for me sneakin' off, ain't it, and foolish? I wish
I had been doin' somethin' with more snap to it,
just to gratify Pennyroyal. But at first, you
see, I didn't mean nothin' in particular by not
tellin', knowin' that folks would think my real
reason outlandish, but by and by when the
town got so all-fired curious and kept sayin' I
was up to different sorts of mischief, I just
thought I'd keep 'em guessin'." Now the long
face was quivering in its eagerness to make
things clear. "Why, it seems to me from the
time that the first green tips come peepin' up
between the stubble in the winter fields I kin
hear that Solomon Song a-beatin' and a-beatin'
in my ears. 'Rise up, my love, my fair one,
and come away. For, lo, the winter is past, the
rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the
earth; the time of the singing of birds has come,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
land.'"</p>

<p>But poor Miner was making a cup for his
ear with his hand. "But turtles ain't voices,
Ambrose, that anybody knows of," he murmured
dimly; "it's frogs we hear croakin' along
the river bank."</p>

<p>And this time Ambrose laughed to himself.
"It's croaks you're always hearin', old fellow,
ain't it?" he whispered affectionately. And
then&mdash;"I reckon it makes no difference to me
whether it's a frog or a turtle, a bird or even a
tree toad. It's the song of life, I'm listenin'
for, Miner."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PEACHY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nevertheless</span>, in spite of Ambrose's intentionally
truthful declaration to Miner, for the
rest of that afternoon and evening he was never
wholly able to get free from the thought of
Peachy. However, he did not then stir from
his first shelter in the woods, finding endless
refreshment in the beauty of the Kentucky
river landscape, nor did he surrender himself
readily to the lure of the feminine; but poor
Ambrose was a victim of the strange force that
lies embodied within a universal idea.</p>

<p>A bird appearing on the branch of a tree above
his head and bending over, peeped into his face
twittering: "Pe-che, Pe-che," as impudently as
any small Susan; then, catching his eye, with
a little mocking courtesy, flew away. A robin
hopping on the grass near the boy's side, pecked
at the crumbs left over from his luncheon; her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
full breast, her air of concentrated domesticity
somehow recalled the image of his latest affection&mdash;Peachy,
the youthful mistress of the Red
Farm.</p>

<p>Now in setting out on this spring pilgrimage
nothing had been farther from the traveller's intention
than any dallying with his familiar weakness.
Girls&mdash;why, the years behind Ambrose
Thompson blossomed with them; never could he
recall a season since his extremest boyhood when
he had not been enchantingly in love. But
actually there was little reason why Peachy
Williams should be thrust upon him more than
another save that he was growing older and
had been devoting some time to her of late.
Besides which, she was comely.</p>

<p>Toward nightfall the bird songs became such
intimate revelations of love that several times
the listener put his fingers into his ears in his
effort to fight their suggestions away. And yet
it was not until next morning that his decision
actually broke.</p>

<p>And then it was not so much a matter of emotion.
But he had had an uncomfortable night
of fitful dreaming and awakened with yesterday's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
spiritual elation gone and with an intense
desire for human companionship.</p>

<p>Rising first on one elbow, Ambrose made a remark
which has probably been considered by
the greater portion of the male creation. "I
wonder now," he asked himself, "ef bein' looked
after and made over ain't sometimes better'n
bein' free?"</p>

<p>A very little while after this the boy cooked
his own breakfast, with extremely poor results,
and then making as pleasing a toilet as his reflection
in the river permitted, immediately set
out in the direction of the Red Farm. And no
longer did Ambrose's face show signs of struggle:
his air had now become one of peaceful acquiescence
in the laws of nature. He had no idea of
committing himself definitely, however, by this
visit to Peachy; his mind was not wholly made
up and he desired nothing abrupt or startling;
it was simply that at present a day of solitary
musing did not appear so appealing as her
companionship, and moreover, Ambrose shared
the universal masculine delusion that his was
the important mind to be made up.</p>

<p>A sense of humour means a sense of proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and therefore an appreciation of values,
so Ambrose Thompson, the young Kentucky
Romeo, was not without a certain thrifty streak.
In driving along it was not disagreeable to
reflect that the Red Farm was the richest tobacco
farm in the county and that Peachy was
its sole heiress. Not that Peachy by herself
was insufficient; Ambrose also had pleasure in
recalling the firmness of her young bosom, the
sheen of her auburn hair, the whiteness of her
teeth&mdash;and then&mdash;how frequently and how
delightfully she laughed. That her laugh was
non-committal had not up to this time troubled
her admirer, who yearned for a feminine audience
and had not yet learned to ask that this
audience be discriminating.</p>

<p>Even feeding chickens may be made an alluring
picture, or at least Ambrose thought so,
when he had driven unobserved into the farmyard
and waited there watching Peachy, with
her sleeves rolled back, flinging the corn to the
ground. Also with his accustomed sensitiveness
to impressions the boy realized that the
girl herself was not unlike one of her own
creamy leghorn hens; she, too, was both red and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
white with her clear healthy skin, red hair, and
red-brown eyes&mdash;and then the fulness of her
figure! The young man laughed delightedly,
when turning and catching sight of him the
girl started running toward him with short, uneven
steps that yet got over the ground very
quickly, and actually when she spoke, there was
a little cluck to her voice.</p>

<p>And yet, somehow, Peachy did not seem to feel
the same degree of surprise that her visitor did
at his own unexpected appearance. She blushed
when he kissed her hand with an ardour peculiar
to Ambrose though foreign to custom in the
"Pennyrile," but she betrayed no wonder at his
visit in the broad daylight when plainly he
should have been at work in his store. Neither
did she ask questions. Notwithstanding, after a
few words of greeting, Ambrose had the impression
of being shooed into the house, Peachy
using her white apron for the purpose.</p>

<p>Yet this had not been his intention, for indeed
he had arrived at the farm an hour before dinner,
with the idea of taking Peachy out for a walk
and then possibly confiding to her the original
purpose of his escape from Pennyroyal; surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>she</i> could be made to understand better than
any one else, and his mood was now one requiring
sympathy. Instead, however, there was
something mysterious the matter with the
girl's costume, so that Ambrose shortly found
himself divested of his hat and duster and shut
up in a sticky parlour with the family album on
his lap for entertainment, and only one window
open to give him just enough light to be able
faintly to see and air to keep barely alive. On
entering the room his first impulse naturally had
been to fling open wide all the windows, but
hearing his hostess's cries of horror, both his
arms and his inclination had weakened. Although
truly the lawn about the Red Farm
house was exquisitely green and free from dust,
yet the thought of possible desecration to the
best parlour had the effect of reality.</p>

<p>Now although Ambrose was miserably settled
according to Peachy's directions, and in spite of
having expressed the desire to change her dress
at once, the girl still lingered on, her face wearing
a look that troubled her suitor as it was so unlike
her usually placid and admiring one. Her red
lips were drawn, her brow puckered, her atmosphere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
one of extreme disapproval. Under the
circumstances Ambrose's forehead was naturally
moist with perspiration and his face not
overly clean, yet his clothes, notwithstanding
being somewhat crumpled and dusty, were
plainly his Sunday best.</p>

<p>"What is it, Peachy?" he asked, first studying
himself solicitously. Then, following her shuddering
gaze across the crimson splendour of the
Brussels carpet, he beheld a track of mud made
with footprints so large that they could belong
to no other feet than his. His eyes dropped.
Surely his feet were caked with mud&mdash;mud
from the shadowy cool depth of the woods, from
the banks of that celestial river so lately deserted
by him. Yet, seeing the girl's unhappiness,
again the young man surrendered and so for a
longtime (it was hard to tell how long) continued
sitting in the same place. Peachy had gone
away, to remain perhaps till dinner time, and
taken his shoes with her. So Ambrose's feet were
now encased in a pair of hot carpet slippers, a
whole size too small for him, so that he could not
even shuffle without crumpling his toes or else
walking about in his socks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Several times he sighed, pushing back his long
hair, a gesture with him expressive of mental
unrest. Why, oh, why, had he given up his
original plan of two days' solitary freedom and
companionship with nature? Peachy had never
seemed less alluring, and as for physical comfort
or even the pleasure of her society, had he gained
either? Cold shivers every now and then had
their way up and down the young man's spine in
the course of his meditations, notwithstanding
the warmth of the room. For he knew himself
to be easily stirred, so supposing that he and
Peachy had taken the walk together that morning
and something serious had happened! By
and by young Ambrose began to feel as utterly
uninterested in female charms, as cool and remote
as a snow-capped mountain, and at about
this moment Peachy returned to the room.</p>

<p>She was wearing a pure white dress and, moving
over into a dark corner, smiling at her
suitor, she sat down on a small sofa. Here, by
dint of pinning his toes down into his slippers,
and letting his heels rise above them, Ambrose
managed to arrive a few seconds later. He was
close up beside her, as comfortably near as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Peachy's starched clothes permitted, liking the
clean smell of her dress, the perfume of her
body; there were odours about her of warm new
milk, of fresh honey, of ripening fruits.</p>

<p>And quite by accident, it seemed to him, the
girl's plump hand was laid near his, so that a
moment later it required pressing. Then the
kerchief about her full breast, rising and falling
softly, showed a hint of something whiter and
softer beneath. With surprising rapidity the
boy's recent regret for his lost holiday began
slipping away from him. The room was still
close, but a breeze blowing in from the partly
raised window fanned them both. Perhaps
Ambrose's head was swimming from fatigue
and drowsiness, perhaps from his sense of his
companion's nearness, of her readiness to fall
into his arms with his first desiring touch.</p>

<p>"Peachy," Ambrose was whispering, when
stealthily the door of the parlour opened, and
there stood Peachy's father, his red face wearing
such an expression of amusement and coarse
understanding that instantly Ambrose felt a
return of his former coldness. His boots having
been cleaned and returned to him five minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
later, he followed the farmer and his daughter
into their dining-room.</p>

<p>There the meal was a hideous one to him despite
his hunger and the good and plentiful food.
For seated at the family table, were several farm
hands, white overseers of the negro labourers,
and they made stupid jokes, shoving their elbows
into one another and grinning idiotically
from Peachy to him. Their ugly thoughts were
like palpable close presences in the room, destroying
all possible illusions for the boy, and
yet the girl herself seemed not to mind. Instead,
she blushed and bridled, sending challenging
looks at Ambrose across the spring freshness of
his piled-up plate of new potatoes, jowl, and
spring greens each time he attempted putting
his fork up to his mouth.</p>

<p>So that after a while, inch by inch, the boy
felt himself being pushed into a corner where he
had meant to walk one day of his own accord.
And by the time dinner was over, not only had
all desire passed from him, but apparently all
will power as well. For next he allowed Peachy
to lead him to an enclosed summer house. This
summer house was some distance away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the big place and so shut in by carefully trained
vines that it allowed no opportunity for distracting
views or vistas beyond. It was what
one under some circumstances might have
called, "a chosen spot."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 243px;"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
<img src="images/i-060.jpg" width="243" height="400" alt="&quot;The Village&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The Village&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Now there is no reasonable explanation of why
Peachy Williams, the chief heiress of "the Pennyrile,"
had so set her heart upon the possession of
Ambrose Thompson. Lovers were plentiful, and
among them the rich owner of the place adjoining
her father's, and Ambrose had no fortune
worth mentioning, and, moreover, was distinctly
homely; but perhaps Peachy was drawn as many
another woman has been before&mdash;by the lure of
the unknown; for never could she have any
proper understanding of Ambrose Thompson's
temperament. Times were when he appeared
more ardent than any of her other suitors, and
then his attention being distracted, both physically
and mentally he faded from sight. Now in
contrast Peachy's own disposition was direct and
simple. At a distance from the Red Farm to
the village she recognized that her lover might
be difficult to control, but near at hand she believed
him tractable, and in a measure this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
true, for Ambrose could always be managed by
his friends up to a certain point&mdash;only the
trouble was that at this time of life Peachy Williams
did not understand where this point ended.</p>

<p>Like a long tallow candle slowly melting from
the heat, the young man was now lolling idly on
the narrow circular bench of the summer house
appearing so limp and dispirited that he seemed
incapable of any kind of opposition.</p>

<p>Would the afternoon never pass? Could he
ever remember having been forced to remain so
long in the society of any one woman? So long
that he ceased to have anything he desired to say
or any possible idea that he wished to express;
indeed his mind felt as clean and empty as a slate
wiped by a wet rag. Why in heaven's name didn't
Peachy herself have something to say once in a
while? Before this day his calls had been short
evening ones, when he had had opinions of his
own and to spare. Could the time ever come in
a man's life when he might want a girl to be inspiration
as well as audience, to have an idea of
her own now and then?</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord," Ambrose groaned half aloud. If
only he could think of some plan of escape, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the rash enthusiasm of his arrival at the farm
had he not promised Peachy to remain all day?
And now in his exhausted condition even his imagination
had deserted him. Certainly he could
think of no excuse for getting away at once.</p>

<p>Yet more and more depressing were Peachy's
long silences, her frequent laugh more irritating,
since Ambrose could find no reasonable excuse
for laughter in the dulness of the interminable
May afternoon with nothing to look at but the
ground at his feet, or the lacing of leaves overhead,
except Peachy, stitching, stitching everlastingly
on something so white and weblike that
Ambrose felt he too was being sewed in, made
prisoner for life.</p>

<p>His long legs twitched, fairly his body ached
with his longing to be off, until by and by even
the girl was made to realize that things were
not going as she had reasonably expected.</p>

<p>"What is it ails you this afternoon, Ambrose?"
she asked at last, wistful if he had but known
it. "Wasn't there something special you wanted
to say to me to-day, else why did you come so
out of your regular time?"</p>

<p>"Why had he come?" Barely was Ambrose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
able to repress another groan. For the life of
him he could not now have told what had drawn
him that morning to the Red Farm. Whatever
desires or emotions had then stirred him were
gone, his head was heavy, his blood moved
languidly, even the necessary domestic noises of
farm life were inexpressibly annoying. Could
Peachy ever have spelled romance? Sighing
aloud Ambrose put up his hand to wipe fresh
moisture from his brow, and then coloured.</p>

<p>"I'm afeard you're ill," the girl continued,
suddenly solicitous, and again with a movement
that suggested a motherly hen: "You're so quiet
and unlike yourself and yet so nervous and wriggly."</p>

<p>Ambrose yawned. "I slep' out last night, so
mebbe I'm tired," he confessed unadvisedly;
then immediately observed the same expression
on Peachy's face that had been brought there by
the presence of his muddy boots in her parlour.
Her lips had tightened, though her brow was
smooth; it was that gentle but awful look of the
born manager.</p>

<p>"I knowed you'd been doin' something foolish,"
she stated calmly. "Anybody else'd remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
there is chills and fever out of doors these
spring nights. It's the spring that has set in
on you; your blood needs thinnin'. I'll get
you some sassafras tea." Relieved by Ambrose's
revelation, Peachy was for at once starting
off, but the young man caught at her skirts.</p>

<p>Truly the spring was not at present working
on him nor did his blood at this hour require
thinning.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Peachy; it ain't sassafras I'm
needin', thank you just as kindly," he said,
touched and a bit shamed by her interest. "To
tell you the truth, I'm beginnin' to feel restless
wantin' to get back to the woods ag'in. I'll
come back to see you soon," he pleaded, observing
that her head was being shaken with unmoved
persistence. Her reply was final:</p>

<p>"You'll do no such thing, Ambrose Thompson;
you'll stay right here till your queerness has wore
off. Haven't I been worryin' over you ever
since dinner? Think I'll let you go moonin' off
now by yourself with no one to look after you?"
Like young Juno both in her majesty and plenitude,
Peachy did this time move out of sight,
leaving her victim greatly shaken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few moments Ambrose knew that a bitter
herb compound would be poured down his reluctant
throat; later he might be placed in bed between
hot blankets and more sweat drawn from
his lean frame. Really there was no limit to
Peachy's particular kind of mothering femininity,
and since her intentions were kind&mdash;Ambrose
knew himself of old&mdash;before kindness he
would go down like a struck ten-pin. Already
he could feel the blankets closing in over him,
and now in truth he shook with a chill.</p>

<p>Soon after his tall form arose, and then
crouched as it crept forth from the summer
house, stopping only long enough to pin a white
paper to the outside arbour, when with leaps and
bounds it disappeared inside the stable, to reappear
a few moments later with old Liza
hitched to his high gig. Driving as rapidly as
possible he soon got past the outside farm gate
leading into the road.</p>

<p>So when Peachy returned with cup and spoon
in hand she found her shrine deserted and instead
read this note pinned outside among the
vines and scrawled in the handwriting of Ambrose
Thompson:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You were right, Peachy dear, I'm not myself to-day.
I <i>am</i> cold and my heart action is uncommon feeble, so I
think I'd best not stay to worry you. Maybe I'll be
coming back to the farm some day when I'm feeling
different.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your respectful</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Ambrose.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>However, safe on the road, Ambrose, looking
back and catching a far image of Peachy with
his letter in her hand, decided that never again
should he return to the Red Farm. For not
only was Ambrose fleeing, but knew the reason
why. Peachy was a manager, and had that
moment in the parlour before dinner been longer&mdash;well,
thank God and old Liza, he was still
free.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, deliver me!" the boy prayed,
though being a good Baptist he knew no litany
save that of his own soul.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>
"Even so, Love, even so!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whither thou goest, I will go."</span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">So the</span> boy continued driving on and on,
loitering in the faint sweet-smelling May afternoon.</p>

<p>At first after having left the farm his heart
had been troubled and his mind uneasy, burdened
by an unconscious wave of sex weariness.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said aloud once, "seems such a
pity you didn't make all critturs the same sex; I
ain't carin' which, male or female, seein' what a
lot of trouble we might all then 'a' been saved."</p>

<p>Naturally, so far as Ambrose himself was concerned,
he was through with the dangers lurking
in feminine society forever! He even intended
confessing this conviction to his friend and
partner, Miner, as soon as they should be alone
together, for even at the moment of his resolution
had not the boy's subliminal self whispered
that he might need strengthening later on?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>After getting well away from his danger zone,
however, Ambrose had chosen that the remainder
of his spring journey should lie through an
unfamiliar part of the state, and so had
turned his horse into every likely lane presenting
itself until by degrees the ever-increasing
beauty of the landscape wrought its effect upon
his susceptible soul.</p>

<p>The houses along his route were finer than
those of his own neighbourhood and, being placed
farther back, showed only a chimney, or the
white fluted column of a veranda every now and
then beyond the closely planted avenues of beech
or maple trees. Sounding across the fields came
the voices of the darkies closing their day's tasks
with songs. Truly this Kentucky was a happy
land in the days before the war, and on this afternoon
there were myriads of the soft, green growing
things toward which Ambrose's young spirit
had yearned,&mdash;acres of corn just creeping above
the mould, and miles of tiny tobacco plants.</p>

<p>Then unexpectedly this character of landscape
disappeared, and old Liza trotted on to a hard
white turnpike. The twilight was closing
down, but a toll-gate keeper showed himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a few yards ahead, and then a cluster of small
stores. Afterward there was nothing further to
interest Ambrose until he drove straight up to a
big building surrounded by a high fence and set
in the middle of a grassless yard without the influence
of a tree or vine near it and where from
the inside came the murmur of children's voices
hushed to a pathetic, uniform note.</p>

<p>The boy knew the place at once for a county
orphan asylum, and being what he was, reflected.
In times past he had seen these same orphans
led through the streets of Pennyroyal, a dreary
set of little human beings, dressed alike and
made to keep step like a chain gang. "Glory,"
he whispered, "here am I running away from the
fear of havin' to keep step with <i>one</i> person;
what if I had been made to keep step with so
many?"</p>

<p>The next moment brought him nearly opposite
a woodpile, and there he slowed up, for he thought
that he heard a noise behind it sounding like a
scared sheep or lamb.</p>

<p>"Stop!" What looked like a child's figure
instantly rose and ran toward him. "Hide
me!" she gasped; "oh, please be quick and don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
ask questions." And the girl clung so tightly
to the spokes of the gig wheel that had the young
man driven on she must have been dragged like
a slave at his chariot.</p>

<p>But of course he did no such thing. "Hop
in," he replied cheerfully. Then, while the child
crouched shivering and panting against his
knee under the thin laprobe, Ambrose whistled
to indicate his entire lack of concern in this
latest adventure, and also to suggest that he
rode alone.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, however, he began wondering
what character of person he had rescued and
from what or from whom she was running away,
it being characteristic of Ambrose that first
he had done what was required of him, and later
had desired to ask questions. In the haste and
semi-darkness it had been impossible to tell
whether the child was a gypsy or a mere ordinary
waif, and she had looked so young&mdash;twelve
or a little more perhaps. There was
nothing much to judge by except that she was
little and light and that her eyes were dark and
shiny and she had two braids of long hair.
But by and by of its own accord the figure under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the laprobe started talking. "Don't let anybody
take me away,&mdash;say you ain't seen me
if they come along," she pleaded in such a tone
that it was only possible for Ambrose to give a
reassuring pat to her head and then to drive
more rapidly along. Once when there was a
moment of unusual stillness he did peep under
the laprobe, only to catch sight of a pair of grateful
eyes upturned to his and to jerk back his
hand from the touch of cold lips.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes of what had seemed totally
unnecessary hiding, as there were few vehicles
abroad on the turnpike at this late hour, and
then both the occupants of the gig heard a furious
pounding of a horse's hoofs behind them and
knew that something or some one was being
pursued.</p>

<p>The girl's clasp tightened, and Ambrose could
catch, not the words, but the sound of a prayer.
Harder than ever before in all their ten years of
friendly intimacy the boy now spurred on old
Liza. It might have been just as well had he
known why he was being thus chivalrous, but
there had been no opportunity so far for finding
out, and everything in Ambrose played gallantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with this new adventure. He was still a
boy with a boy's love of mischief, of hiding, of
winning in any kind of game, and susceptibility
to instant sympathy.</p>

<p>Old Liza was a retired racehorse, and although
her retirement dated some years back, still she
was subject to spurts of speed. However, the
best of spurts won't hold out long, and soon her
driver realized that the wagon behind was gaining
on him every moment.</p>

<p>"Keep still!" he ordered, deliberately pulling
up short in the middle of the road. With a
quick movement, seeing that the truant was completely
hidden, he set his carpet-bag up on his
lap, and, opening it, began rummaging among its
contents. When the other wagon was within
hailing distance he turned slowly about.</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord for trifles, stranger," he
called. "I wonder now if you would mind pausin'
and givin' me a light; I got my pipe and tobacco"&mdash;he
held out an old-time corncob pipe&mdash;"but
maybe you be hurryin' on to a sick person."</p>

<p>Naturally the other man hesitated. Ambrose's
solemn long face was fairly plain to view, also his
manner of having all eternity before him. Eying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
him suspiciously, the newcomer thrust forth
his own lighted pipe, Ambrose managing to keep
his carpet-bag between them.</p>

<p>"You ain't seen anything of a runaway girl?"
the man asked.</p>

<p>Ambrose nodded with irritating precision, the
time being consumed in scrutiny of his questioner's
face. The man had lantern jaws, small,
hard eyes, and an expression of official authority
peculiarly annoying to certain members of
the laity.</p>

<p>"There was a girl a piece back hidin' behind
a woodpile; thought maybe she was playin'
hide and seek." Here the speaker laughed.
"Reckon you suspicioned she was a pretty fair
runner if you're chasin' a girl along the high-road
with that horse. Most any human would
have had the sense to hide." Here the reins
flapped on old Liza's back and she took a few
steps forward.</p>

<p>Evidently Ambrose's words had not been without
effect, for the stranger did not hurry on at
once, neither did he reveal any misgiving in connection
with the young man nor the amount of
property being transported at the front of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
gig, for the country people of that day were
accustomed to doing their own carrying.</p>

<p>Safety with honours! A smile began playing
about Ambrose's face, when suddenly a kind of
miniature convulsion shook his leg, followed by
a choking, spluttering noise that was plainly a
terrified sneeze.</p>

<p>And instantly the hand of the man in the
wagon reached forward, but he was not within
reaching distance, and at the same instant Ambrose,
seizing hold of his passenger, made a flying
leap from the gig. Then catching the girl's
hand in his he ran with her, ran gloriously,
hardly conscious of the light figure being drawn
along. All day his long legs had been cramped
with sitting still; this, then, was the thing that
he had most desired: leaping ditches, tearing
across ploughed fields to the woods ahead, with
the frightened girl panting but keeping close
to his side, and behind them the enraged, shouting
figure of officialdom.</p>

<p>Once in the woods the hiding was easy; twisting
in and out among the trees not only did
Ambrose lose his pursuer, but himself. For if he
had counted on anything, which he probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
had not, it was that the man would not run
after them for any length of time, leaving his
fast horse to stand in the road.</p>

<p>Finally, the girl and boy both dropped down
on the ground. The long May twilight was
past, still they could see the outlines of each
other's forms, and Ambrose could hear the
beating of the girl's heart against her frock like
the fluttering of an imprisoned moth.</p>

<p>He could not help reassuring her. "You're
safe, sis, don't worry," he drawled. "Keep still
and maybe in a minute I'll find some water."</p>

<p>But she would not let him leave her, and
tagged along until they finally discovered a
little stream. Then, as Ambrose had some
stale bread in his pocket, together they feasted
for a short time, when, as the moon of the
night before had come out again a trifle larger,
Ambrose decided to inquire concerning his
companion's plans. She now seemed entirely
peaceful, and, though rested, had made no mention
of moving along. However, for some time
longer he watched her with that solemn stare
of his. She was chattering gayly enough about
nothing ("there was never a time when a female<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
wouldn't be able to talk," he thought),
but by and by she <i>must</i> be interrupted.</p>

<p>"I wonder now," he said when there was no
longer any sound either of fear or fatigue in her
voice, "if you would kindly be tellin' me which
way you would like to be goin' and what friends
you was plannin' to run to to-night when I
picked you up back on the road? I ain't to say
acquainted with this part of the country, but I
reckon I can help to find them. It's gettin'
late and I ain't easy in my mind about Liza."</p>

<p>For some absurd reason he felt himself placed
upon the defensive.</p>

<p>The girl was shaking her head. "I ain't no
friend but you."</p>

<p>Ambrose whistled. "Well, bein's as I am
what one might call a recently adopted friend,
maybe you'll so much as tell me where you're
thinkin' of spendin' the night."</p>

<p>"I ain't thinkin'," was the answer, and at this
Ambrose swore softly, though you may count
on his having sworn under his breath.</p>

<p>"Look here, you got to tell me a straight story.
I ought to 'a' made you before," he confessed.
"I reckon I knew you were runnin' away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that orphan asylum and I kind of wanted to
help, even more when that fellow came after you,
but we can't go traipsin' around all night, and I
got to find Liza. You oughtn't to have run
away from a good asylum if you hadn't no
friends."</p>

<p>Ambrose knew himself for a liar before the girl
on the ground began rocking herself back and
forth with her hands clasped over her knees.</p>

<p>"I ought to, I ought to, I ought to," she repeated
until her words had the swaying influence
of a chant. "You know nothin' about it. I
have been in that place so long I can't remember
anywheres else. How can I have friends? I
don't know nobody, I don't love nobody, I ain't
nobody! Why, there's mornings when I get up
and lookin' at the other orphans, seein' we are
dressed alike and got to do the same things at
the same time all day, I begin to think maybe
there ain't any <i>me</i>. I'm just one of them&mdash;any
one." She began crying now, but that did not
interrupt her passionate speech. "I've been
thinkin' of runnin' away a long time. P'raps I'll
have a hard time; I don't care. Ain't I a right
to find out?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>And this of course the young man could not
answer, so he only passed his hand over his brow.
"Well, you might 'a' stayed at the asylum a
little longer," and then because he was Ambrose,
"or at least till I got safely past that woodpile."</p>

<p>"I was too old," she defended. "I ought not
to have stayed so long as I did, only nobody
knew what to do with me." She was looking up
into her companion's face close, that she might
find something more of help in it. "Maybe you
know some one that might want me? I know
lots of things, cleanin' and cookin' some&mdash;&mdash;"
She would like to have continued to pour out
her poor list of accomplishments, but Ambrose
stopped her.</p>

<p>For some time the fear had been growing upon
him that the child he believed himself to have
rescued was not so much a child as he had first
supposed. Of course he had never seen her very
plainly and there was nothing to judge by in her
short, scant dress. "Would you mind," he now
inquired, "tellin' me just about how old you
are?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen."</p>

<p>Ambrose groaned. For in Kentucky half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
century ago, you must remember, sixteen was
thought an age nearer that of a woman than
of a girl.</p>

<p>"Then I've got to take you back to the orphans,"
he announced.</p>

<p>However, his declaration had not even the distinction
of being listened to, for the girl, with her
chin sunk in her clasped hands, was plainly
thinking of something else. Now she put one
hand timidly on his coat sleeve, and Ambrose
could see that she had a curiously pointed chin
and that her eyes were like deep wells with the
moonlight shining down into them. "Maybe
you'll tell me where <i>you're</i> thinkin' of stayin' the
night?"</p>

<p>"The Lord knows <i>only</i>." And here yesterday's
adventurer had a sudden vision of himself
setting forth on his journey to be alone with nature.
On the morning of the second day he had
been almost caught in a trap of his own setting,
and now at nightfall was probably in a worse fix.
"I had been thinkin', though, of spendin' the
night somewhere peaceful-like in the woods," he
growled.</p>

<p>The girl clapped her hands together and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
yawning, drew closer to her new friend, almost as
if she meant to rest her head upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Then let me stay with you, please," she
begged, and Ambrose could feel her warm breath
on his cheek. "The woods is big and there's
plenty of room for me, too. I shan't be afraid
with you, and I've never seen the stars, except
through the window."</p>

<p>The boy rose. "No," he said harshly, "you
can't stay alone in the woods at night with me.
I reckon before this I understood you didn't
know nothing."</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward they found old Liza
cropping grass, a little off the main road where
they had left her. When both of them had
returned to the gig Ambrose drove on in silence
with an uncommonly bored face.</p>

<p>Later the moon went behind a cloud and a
light mist fell, and then the girl's body began
swaying gently backward and forward. Once
she fell too far forward, when, still frowning, her
companion slipped an arm about her, and a moment
later she was fast asleep with her head
resting on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Ambrose breathed deeply of the odour of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fresh wet earth. It was like the perfume of her
young body; the moist curls about her face like
the damp tendrils of new vines. Soon the boy's
shoulder ached, and his entire left side, including
his leg, seemed to have gone to sleep. Now and
then he wondered if it ever should wake again in
this world; and yet try as he might Ambrose
Thompson could not make up his mind that he
actually disliked the presence of the girl with
him, and never from youth to old age had he the
talent for deceiving himself.</p>

<p>"Poor kid," he murmured more than once,
"she must 'a' been lyin' awake nights plannin'
to run away, with no place on God's earth to run
to."</p>

<p>Seldom did he allow himself the pleasure of
looking long at her, and only once did his lips
move toward hers, and then, though his face
worked, they were drawn sharply back.</p>

<p>"Lord!" he whispered after this, "whatever
shall I do with her?" A stranger in that part
of the country himself, he knew of no one to ask
to shelter the girl, and take her back to the asylum
he would not. Should he turn her over to a
stranger she would promptly be sent back there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the morning. Yet here were the lights of a
village showing close ahead of them, and every
now and then old Liza stumbled, almost falling
from weariness.</p>

<p>Ambrose's prayer half awakened the girl.
Anyhow, she sat up for a moment rubbing her
eyes, to hear him asking: "Whatever is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Sarah," and then her head swayed again.</p>

<p>But Ambrose sat straight up giving his
reins an unexpected joyous flap. "Glory, why
ain't I thought of it before?" he asked of no one.
Then aloud: "When Abraham drew near to the
land of the Egyptians didn't he admonish Sarah,
his wife, to say she was his sister that it might be
well with him and that his soul should live?"
He grinned silently. "I'm findin' the patriarchs
pretty useful this trip, but I reckon if Abraham
could say that his wife Sarah was his sister to
save his <i>own</i> skin, I can tell the same kind of a
one to save a girl."</p>

<p>"Wake up, Sarah," he urged, when a few moments
later he drew rein before a red brick tavern
door, "and if anybody asks questions, recollect
you are to say you're my sister."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>However, on that same evening, when Sarah
put up her lips for a sister's good night kiss, it
was the boy who turned away. There was something
in this girl that called to him too strongly,
something fragrant and as yet unawakened, and
then he had not dreamed she was so pretty, with
her scarlet cheeks and big, heavy-lidded eyes,
some poor little child of Eve from a far different
land than his blond Kentucky. It looked, too,
as though the little force the girl had, had now
spent itself in her one effort of running a way, and
hereafter some one would surely have to look
after her. "Not only had she never been taught
at the asylum to think for herself," the boy reflected,
"she ain't never even been allowed to."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the girl slept untroubled in her
high-post bed in the best guest chamber of the
tavern, while Ambrose in a tiny room close under
the roof, lay awake for a long time. He was not
in the woods alone as he had dreamed of being,
and yet he was not unhappy. He was not listening
to the voices of nature as he knew her, but to
the stirrings of his own blood, to the beating of
his own heart.</p>

<p>More than once in order to stay his restlessness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Ambrose had risen from his bed and stood
leaning and looking out of his window at the
stars and breathing deep the odours of the night.
Still he could see nor feel nothing except the presence
of the strange girl near him, the appeal of
her utter helplessness. And yet the boy did not
understand that the song of life he had come
forth to hear was being sung to him for the first
time to-night. For he only kept repeating to
himself over and over: "Whatever am I to do
with her, poor little kid?" until he also fell
asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RETURN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> the fourth morning since Ambrose's
departure, and county court day in Pennyroyal.
The hour was just before noon, so the men had
already left the court-house and were standing
around in groups talking politics, while the
younger ones paraded, walking shoulder to
shoulder for mutual support and encouragement.
The main street was also fluttering with girls,
a variety of household errands having brought
them forth at this hour; on their arms fresh sunbonnets
trembled, in their eyes wonderful things
danced, and indeed almost all of them were fair.
Yet in the doorway of the drygoods firm of
Hobbs &amp; Thompson Miner Hobbs stood wrapped
in gloom; the girls had giggled for him and at
him vainly. More than eighty-six hours had
passed bringing no word from his partner.</p>

<p>Suddenly a vibration swept through the air as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
tangible as the pealing of bells. Ambrose was
on his way back into Pennyroyal. The news
must have had its origin somewhere out of sight,
for now it was travelling swiftly by word of
mouth.</p>

<p>One moment the older men ceased arguing
and spat widely, the girls turned their eyes away
from their admirers, even the youths glanced up
the hill, for the story grew that not only was Ambrose
returning, but that he did not ride alone.</p>

<p>By and by, though still some distance off,
Miner beheld old Liza drawing the familiar gig.
About her neck hung a garland of buttercups
and daisies, above one twitching ear appeared a
bouquet of wild flowers and sweet fern tied with
flowing streamers of white cotton-back satin
ribbon, while upright on the floor of the gig stood
Ambrose.</p>

<p>As the equipage advanced Miner leaned
against his door frame.</p>

<p>Ambrose was wearing a new stove-pipe hat,
his swallow tailed coat revealed a new beflowered
waistcoat, and in his buttonhole blossomed a
rose. But Miner swept details aside. On Ambrose's
face was the expression that has lit up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the world, and by his side rode a strange girl
never before seen in Pennyroyal.</p>

<p>Ambrose was bowing from right to left, waving
his hat in joyous circles of greeting, while the
girl clung with one hand to an end of his coat
and with the other clutched her paper-flower
bouquet.</p>

<p>When the gig had turned the corner into Linden
street and was moving on toward the rose
cottage the news of its approach had preceded
it, for the wooden sidewalk close by was lined
and there in the forefront stood Susan Barrows,
her hands on her hips and her bunches of corkscrew
curls bobbing.</p>

<p>"Where on earth did you find <i>that</i> girl, Ambrose
Thompson?" she called out as soon as the
couple were in hailing distance.</p>

<p>Ambrose drove closer. "I didn't <i>find</i> her,
Miss Susan," he answered, lying like a saint.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrows' eyes bored like old gimlets
sharpened from long use. "She's too young to
be your housekeeper, and she ain't ugly," she
said. "The town'll talk."</p>

<p>But now Liza had stopped of her own accord
in front of home, and Ambrose, letting go of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
reins, put his arm about the girl. Under the
new poke bonnet her face was pale except for the
scarlet of her lips and her dark eyes that never
left their refuge.</p>

<p>The sensitive point to her companion's long
nose quivered. Coming toward them he could
see Miner's six pink-and-white, blond sisters,
and in their wake the dark little man. Miner
was walking like a man at a funeral, with his
head bowed, and that he did not wear a band of
cr&ecirc;pe upon his arm was only that he had lacked
opportunity; everything else suggested a pall.
At the same instant, round the corner of the
cottage, trotted Moses, waving his tail and
wearing a smile of forgiveness. One look, and
ignoring his master's friendly whistle, the little
dog disappeared, not to be seen again for three
days.</p>

<p>Silently Ambrose lifted the stranger down to
the boardwalk and with his arm still about her
turned to face Susan. Perhaps there was something
of appeal in the familiar solemnity of his
gaze and in his whimsical drawl:</p>

<p>"We'll let the town talk, Susan, won't we, or
it'll bust?" he replied quietly. "No, ma'am,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
she ain't my hired housekeeper; no ma'am, she
ain't no relation of mine; that is, no born blood
kin." With this he began leading Sarah to the
shelter of his own yard and, drawing her in,
closed the gate.</p>

<p>"But we're pretty closely related, Susan."
Purposely Ambrose's voice was raised. He then
took a few irresistibly jubilant steps backward
and forward, swinging the girl with him. "She's
my wife!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RECONSTRUCTION</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> long has it been since, Mrs. Barrows?"
asked the Baptist minister.</p>

<p>"Eight years, Brother Bibbs," Susan answered.</p>

<p>They were standing in front of Susan Barrows'
cottage one late June afternoon in the
summer of 1866.</p>

<p>The minister sighed, flapping his worn coat-tails
as a signal of distress. Mrs. Barrows was
gazing at the house next door. There the lilac
bush which had showed its first blossoms on
that morning of Ambrose's runaway had grown
to full estate. Its season having passed, however,
it was no longer in bloom, but instead, the
climbing rose, known in the South as the "Seven
Sisters," was spreading itself above the front
door, bestowing its flowers against the background
of the once rose-coloured cottage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Susan's black curls moved reminiscently, eight
years having wrought no changes in her beyond
the deepening of the original plan. "Yes, eight
years since Ambrose Thompson brought that
orphan child home, and two since she passed
away. Seems that Ambrose wouldn't never
have got off even one year to the war if she
hadn't gone on before, seein' as she wasn't never
willing to let him out of her sight a minute longer'n
she could help."</p>

<p>"A deeply affectionate nature," remarked the
minister.</p>

<p>"A powerful clinger," retorted Susan, "but
men is forgivin' to regular features with a high
colour." She turned at this instant to look
down the street. "I call it chokin' myself to
hang on to a man the way Sarah done to Ambrose
plumb up to the hour she died. What's
always needin' proppin' ain't to my mind worth
the prop. Howsomever, the child is dead, and
I'm hopeful death does change us right considerable,
though I can't see as it changes nothin' of
what we were nor what we done in this world&mdash;and
more's the pity!"</p>

<p>Assuredly Brother Bibbs was growing restless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and Mrs. Barrows talking to cover time.
For five minutes before had she not seen him
attempting to sneak past her gate to gain refuge
in the Thompson cottage unobserved before its
owner could possibly have returned from work?</p>

<p>Then, too, the minister's face was uncommonly
harassed, and these were disjointed days in the
Pennyroyal as well as throughout the entire
country. True, the Civil War was over, which
Susan called "the uncivilest ever fit on God's
earth," but while its wounds and differences
were patched up they were by no means healed.
And Pennyroyal's disposition to regard herself
as one family had made her dissensions peculiarly
bitter. There were times in this past year since
the close of the war when the minister had wondered
if it had not been the bitterest year of all,
for notwithstanding that Kentucky did not
suffer from reconstruction as the states further
south, remember that she was, during and after
the war, a state divided within herself.</p>

<p>There was trouble in the Pennyroyal air this
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Susan," Brother Bibbs suggested,
as getting out his pocket handkerchief he removed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a slight moisture from his eyes. "Ambrose
and Sarah loved one another, that was the
main thing. Theirs was a spring mating, and,
like the birds whose season they chose, brief,
too brief in passing." Attempting now to move,
Brother Bibbs found it impossible, since in his
moment of sentiment Mrs. Barrows, leaning
over her fence, had linked her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Well, thank the Lord the little love bird
didn't leave a young one in the nest for me and
the male to look after," she argued more leniently.
"Come right on in, Brother, and rest
yourself, as I kin see Ambrose and his two
shadders advancin' toward us up the street, and
a peskier pair of shadders than Miner Hobbs
and that dog, Moses, I ain't never seen, but it's
true the two of 'em ain't left Ambrose to himself
a minute since his wife died."</p>

<p>With her free hand Susan now waved a friendly
greeting, even releasing at the same time the
vigour of her clutch with the other, for Brother
Bibbs was a fragile gentleman, an elderly widower,
and, excepting in matters pertaining to
heaven or hell, greatly subject to the sisters in
his congregation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Also the three figures were almost in plain
sight, the little man leaning as usual on the arm
of the tall one, with Moses following but a few
steps behind.</p>

<p>Miner Hobbs walked with a slight limp.
Wounded in the battle of Resaca, he had never
entirely recovered, and although not yet thirty
years old already showed signs of advancing age
in his shrivelled appearance, like a nut whose
kernel has failed to ripen.</p>

<p>Moses, however, was remarkably well preserved
and, barring a stiffness in his legs and a
few grizzled hairs, lighter of heart than in many
a year. For since that girl who had come to his
home had suddenly gone away with equal mysteriousness
his master was once more his slave.</p>

<p>On the surface Ambrose seemed to have
changed more than either Miner or the dog.
His face had lost its look of easy laughter, the
crow's feet about the corners of his eyes spoke
of nights of hard service. Perhaps he was even
longer and leaner than ever, while the hair upon
his forehead was slowly beginning to recede like
a wave from the shore.</p>

<p>Now his familiar spirit of fun took hold on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
him. The little man was talking to him earnestly.
"Go easy, Miner," he whispered, bending
his tall head, "ef you want to keep your secret
from the women; there's Miss Susan less'n a
block away." He also continued his teasing
even after joining the minister and Mrs. Barrows,
managing in a few moments to pass with the two
men into his house, leaving the lady bristling
with anger.</p>

<p>"There's somethin' fermentin' in the head of
every man in this here town," she flared, coming
out on to the sidewalk and then following the
trio into Ambrose's yard the better to deliver
her message, "somethin' you're hidin' from the
women, and what men keeps to themselves ain't
no good and never was! Suppose we ain't noticed
you plottin' new mischief together? Like
it wasn't enough," she ended bitterly, "that
women has had to bear a war, go half starved,
and do man's work as well as their own 'thout
bein' asked whether they'd like a war or not.
Wonder if the good time's comin' when women
kin reveal what they think and not have
to stand fer the things they don't have no hand
in the makin' of."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Although during this tirade her audience had
disappeared, eternal vigilance was forever Mrs.
Barrows' motto. So now she went on with her
watching, while the three men remained a long
time inside the cottage, and by and by, when
darkness had fallen, other men with their faces
hidden followed in after them. Soon these men
came out, and last of all Miner, Ambrose, and
Brother Bibbs. Miner was scowling; nevertheless
his scowl was concealing an expression of
triumph; the minister's figure plainly showed
defeat, but Ambrose, whatever his former look,
laughed aloud, catching sight of his neighbour
through the gloom, standing on a kitchen chair
and leaning across the dividing rails between her
house and his in order to peep through the closed
slats of his sitting-room window.</p>

<p>"Look out, Miss Susan, the meetin' is over,
and high places is rickety," he called suddenly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrows started guiltily, accomplishing
her own downfall, and over she went with the
wreck of her chair, only to spring up so quickly
afterward that her hoopskirts appeared to carry
her higher than the laws of gravity.</p>

<p>Although assistance from Ambrose arrived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
too late, still he lingered. "Ain't you no faith in
what men undertakes 'thout advice from women,
Miss Susan?" he inquired, and when that lady,
breathless for once, was able only to shake
her head, he gave her a slow, anxious smile, whispering,
"I'm none too sure but you're right,"
before moving along.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, at midnight on the same
night Ambrose and Miner were riding side by
side through the Kentucky woods at the head of
a small cavalcade that had come together silently
on the outskirts of Pennyroyal. The riders
wore masks, excepting Ambrose, who, with face
uncovered, squirmed restlessly upon the sunken
back of old Liza.</p>

<p>"The men have give their word there ain't
nobody goin' to git hurt," he repeated three or
four times, until finally Miner turned upon him.</p>

<p>"Mebbe you'd better not have went, Ambrose,
ef you haven't the nerve," he remarked testily.</p>

<p>And at this the tall man stiffened. "It ain't
nerve, Miner. I just ain't never liked a ten-man-against-one
game in my life, and I ain't hidin'
my sentiments. No more than the rest of
you do I want this Yankee teacher bein' brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
into Pennyrile to show us <i>our</i> business, but I'm
with this crowd to-night to see he don't get hurt
'cept in his feelin's."</p>

<p>"He's got to git, notwithstandin'!" Miner's
attitude was that of a fierce little dog, who even
when he couldn't change a situation liked to bark
in order to hear the noise.</p>

<p>These men had both fought on the Southern
side in the Civil War, but with a difference.
Miner had plunged into it at once with pigheadedness
and with passion; the full story of why
Ambrose had failed to go south when his comrades
did has not been told by Mrs. Barrows.
At that time most men's hearts were on the one
side or the other. Ambrose Thompson's heart
was on both sides at once. Indeed, during the
first hateful years of the war he had felt like a
child whose equally beloved parents were engaged
in getting a divorce, and not until after
Miner was wounded and the South had showed
herself the weaker did he heed her mothering
call. And then he was never much of a success
as a soldier because of his habit of so frequently
misplacing his gun while he helped on a weaker
brother, and because of his never having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
known to fire at anything in particular. Still
his companions did not count him a coward,
merely recognizing that his imagination had a
longer reach than theirs.</p>

<p>Kentuckians, however, have not the grace of
easy forgiveness, and also have a fixed determination
to attend to their own affairs. To-night's
expedition meant that the teacher sent from the
North into the Pennyroyal district to instruct
their coloured children must go. Not that
Pennyroyal wished her negroes to remain untaught,
"seein'," as Ambrose had said, "that
readin' and writin' ought to belong to them same
as seein' and smellin'," but because they preferred
to have time to attend to the matter themselves.
Also, the new teacher had been secretly
hurried into the county that day, driven through
the adjoining town, and finally installed in the
Pennyroyal district schoolhouse without Pennyroyal's
being allowed a chance to take even a
look.</p>

<p>This schoolhouse was an old-fashioned log
cabin set in the middle of a clearing in a young
papaw grove, and to-night, with a light burning
in the front room, the oncoming men could see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
through a half-opened window the shadow of a
figure.</p>

<p>Without waiting for word of command, silently
they got down from their horses, forming
a line about the house, and then one man, pounding
savagely on the closed door, shouted: "Come
out from there or we'll drag you out."</p>

<p>There was no answer at first, and when a candle
appeared at the opening of the door the wind
blew it out so quickly that the person holding it
remained in indistinct outline.</p>

<p>Miner, having been previously chosen as
spokesman, now advanced toward this door and
said: "Ahem!" He was feeling it a different
thing to plan to bully a fellow-man by force of
numbers and another to make so ugly a statement
to his face, while Ambrose in even deeper
embarrassment flattened his thin body against
the front wall of the cabin until it suggested a
tall plank left to rest there over night.</p>

<p>"You got to git away from our district school-house
to-night," blurted Miner at last; "Pennyroyal
kin take care of its own coloured children
'thout help from the outside. But you needn't
be scairt, for nobody's goin' to hurt you if you go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
peaceable, but there's a horse waitin' fer you out
here and we'll 'low you fifteen minutes to clear
out."</p>

<p>Then the little man jumped a few steps backward
and the hand of each of his companions
slipped toward the trigger of his gun. However,
whatever of danger the past moment seemed to
have had, it passed swiftly, for the weapon, held
by the lonely figure in the doorway, dropped
to the ground with a peculiar clatter, and an instant
later the voice said:</p>

<p>"There aren't men enough in Kentucky to
make <i>me</i> run away like a thief; if I am made to
go it must be by force." The tones were low
and tremulous, but were sufficiently clear and
held no hint of surrender. Then, putting out
both hands like a child at play in blind man's
buff, the figure groped its way forth from the
cabin, moving directly toward Miner and saying:
"How can I talk with you, though, when
I can't see you? Till to-night I never dreamed
a Kentuckian would be ashamed to show his
face."</p>

<p>Actually Miner's hand shook as he tore off his
mask, for the figure approaching him was that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a woman, possibly a girl, and she must have been
preparing for bed at the time the men arrived,
for her hair was hanging over her shoulders,
and through the opening of her wrapper there
showed the white glimmer of a gown.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of his own shame and chagrin
Ambrose inwardly chuckled, seeing that for
the first time in his life Miner had to discuss a
question with a woman without his primeval
conviction that man was ordained to be always
in the right and woman in the wrong.</p>

<p>"Madam, there has been some mistake; surely
you can see that&mdash;&mdash;" he began pompously.
But the girl shook her head. "I told you I
couldn't <i>see</i> anything."</p>

<p>Something of relief hid in Ambrose's grin this
time, for if the Yankee school teacher had a sense
of humour even the situation in which he and his
companions found themselves was not utterly
hopeless.</p>

<p>But an impatient voice now spoke from the
crowd. "Oh, fer the love of heaven, can't you
understand we didn't know you was a woman?
Reckon we'd all 'a' come shyin' out here to drive
a woman away? You pack up your duds in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
mornin' and leave comfortable, and no more
said."</p>

<p>"I won't," came the defiant answer. Then
changing her tactics, the girl drew nearer Miner,
and putting out one hand almost touched his
coat sleeve, although actually he seemed to
shrivel away under it. "Do let me stay, at least
for a while," she pleaded. "My father was killed
in the war; I have to make my own living and
this is my first chance. I didn't know you would
mind so much. And, please, I am not so very
Yankee&mdash;Indiana is only just across the river."</p>

<p>There were no tears in the voice, but a sound
so suspiciously near them that ten men, shuffling
their feet, wished one of their number would
speak.</p>

<p>At last an answer came from a long shadow
against the front wall of the cabin. "Certain
you kin stay, Miss, and thank you. Just move
on inside your house now and lock the door, for
there's some among us that mebbe won't be
anxious to be recognized later on as havin' give
you&mdash;well, a kind of house warmin' in the
Pennyrile."</p>

<p>A moment later, while his companions were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
mounting their horses, Ambrose lingered, groping
before the closed door; soon he touched something
of strange formation with a smooth back
and a prickly arrangement on the underneath
side. "Lord, what a weapon of defence&mdash;a
hairbrush," he drawled, slipping it into his
pocket as he visioned the girl's interrupted preparations
for the night. And then when old
Liza had caught up with the others: "Boys,
ain't to-night enough to cure us of Ku-Kluxing,
or whatever you want to call this gol darn
business?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EM'LY DUNHAM</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Her</span> name's Em'ly Dunham," announced
Miner shortly.</p>

<p>Ambrose, who at this moment was arranging a
pyramid design of their new stock of calicoes on
a counter in the front of their shop in order to
get the best colour effect, looked up quickly and
then put his hand over his lips.</p>

<p>"Whose named Em'ly Dunham?" he inquired
in a partially stifled voice, with his interest apparently
still concentrated on his work.</p>

<p>"You know, the Yankee school teacher,"
Miner growled. He was standing inside a kind
of wire cage which separated the post-office department
from the rest of the store of Hobbs &amp;
Thompson, the charge of the mail having recently
been given to the two men.</p>

<p>"How'd you find out?"</p>

<p>"Letters!" The little man was assorting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
mail with an energy that Pennyroyal's one dozen
epistles or less a day hardly justified. This was
one morning less than a week after the unsuccessful
midnight excursion.</p>

<p>Ambrose now crossed his feet, resting his
weight on his elbows against the bales of cotton
cloth. He was staring solemnly at his partner.
"Em'ly Dunham is a pretty name, Miner; kind
of soft and gentle, yet with plenty of spirit in it.
I am reckoning some one in Pennyroyal ought
to try and make things up to her."</p>

<p>With a sigh the other man climbed up to perch
on his high official stool. "Ain't you never goin'
to stop thinkin' of females and marryin', Ambrose?
I thought mebbe when you lost Sarah
you was cured!"</p>

<p>Ambrose leaned farther over, shaking his head.
"No," he answered simply, "I reckon not. I
wonder ef you have ever thought, Miner, of how
much them two little words&mdash;livin' and lovin'&mdash;are
alike. I don't think it was an accident, jest
the difference of that one little letter. Not that
I intend marryin' again&mdash;I am through with
marryin' forever&mdash;it's you, Miner Hobbs, I'm
worryin' over." Here, because of his earnestness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Ambrose left his place and coming across
the aisle looked down over the wire netting upon
his friend. "Miner," he repeated as sternly as
he was able, "your time has come. There ain't
nothin' so no 'count on earth as an old bachelor.
It's worse than an old maid and different, because
perhaps an old maid couldn't help gettin'
left out, but the Lord's given every man a chance
to improve his condition jest by askin'. Course
he may have to ask more'n one and mebbe
more'n once, but there ain't no age limit to stop
him. Then think, Miner, what chances always
lies in villages. Why, villages is nature's nunneries.
Ain't it time fer you to do a man's part?"</p>

<p>There was silence for a little time, Miner
making no response, although from over in his
corner Moses growled in his sleep.</p>

<p>Then the tall man coughed apologetically.
He looked tired, as though he had been awake
many hours the night before. "I didn't mean
to rile you any," he continued, "only I can't
help thinkin' that a man without a wife is like a
little boat a-floatin' on the sea of life without a
rudder and bound for nowhere in particular.
Ef you don't marry you'll be awful sorry when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
you're an old man, Miner, and ef you've been
kind of overfed on Pennyrile girls, why, this
here new school teacher&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miner fairly bounced up and down on his stool
in his impatience. "Lord, why shouldn't I be
sorry when I'm old instead of when I'm young?
Mebbe I won't live to get old and then I'd 'a'
made myself wretcheder'n a slave and all fer
nothin'."</p>

<p>At this second, the door opening, the speaker
collapsed, while Ambrose shot backward behind
the counter toward the rear of the shop. A
flood of June sunshine entered with the girl, and
Ambrose heard her name for the second time as
she asked the terrified Miner for her mail. He
also saw her plainly. She was twenty-five or
perhaps a little more, with hair that was brown
or gold as the light shone upon it; gray eyes
set wide apart&mdash;eyes that might at times be
cold and then shine warmly like a cloud suddenly
shot through by the sun; her mouth was
larger and her chin firmer than beauty requires,
and yet both showed curves of frequent and redeeming
laughter. She was tall, with broad
shoulders and a slender body, and there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
about her a hint of delicate and unconscious
coquetry, noticeable as she talked with Miner
while making her purchases, the little man coming
out from his retreat to serve her and afterward
following her into the street, where he was
gone for almost an hour.</p>

<p>In the meantime it was difficult for Ambrose
to attend properly to business, for never before
had his partner left the store during working
hours save for his meals and to attend the wedding
of his sisters, two of whom had happily
passed from his home to homes of their own.
However, no words on the subject were exchanged
when Miner curtly explained that Miss
Dunham had too many bundles for a lady to
carry.</p>

<p>It was after this extraordinary occurrence at
their shop that Miner left Ambrose and Moses
alone for three evenings in succession, the tall man
sitting in his chair in the backyard under a ripening
apple tree, with Moses at his side and his
friend's empty chair near by. But although
Ambrose drooped every now and then, he always
smiled resolutely afterward. "It'll plumb be
the salvation of Miner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>On the fourth night, however, Ambrose, having
gone early to bed and fallen into a light sleep,
was awakened by a knock at his kitchen door,
and on coming downstairs again found his friend
outside. "It ain't no hour to be in bed yet,"
Miner snapped. Knowing the little man had
something unusual on his mind his friend led him
to their accustomed refuge.</p>

<p>Ambrose and Miner were curiously incongruous
figures that night in the garden, for the one
man wore an oriental silk dressing-gown over
a pair of hastily put on blue jean trousers; the
gown, a scheme of deep rich colours and designs,
having drifted into the shop one day by accident,
had been seized upon by Ambrose to gratify a subconscious
craving. It was tied about his waist
with a red cord, and as he lolled back in his chair
his eyes would travel from their study of his
companion's face up toward the stars which he
could see shining through the spaces between
the leaves of his apple tree.</p>

<p>Miner kept his eyes always upon the ground; he
had a chew of tobacco in his mouth, his lips
worked spasmodically, but he did not speak,
neither did be spit as a vent to his feelings, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
tight, small man, buttoned up both inside and
out! By and by, however, when nearly an hour
had passed in silence, he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Reckon I'd better be goin', Ambrose; it's
gettin' late. Good night."</p>

<p>But the tall man pushed him back again into
his chair. "Lord, Miner, is it so hard for you
to tell things, even to me?" he inquired. "Out
with it!"</p>

<p>"Don't you go and be puttin' foolish ideas on to
me if I tell you," Miner pleaded, "but it's just
this: The women have made up their minds
to put Miss Em'ly Dunham out of Pennyrile.
Course we men tried and failed, so we give up,
but when a woman starts out to do a thing, why
she does it. Can't you think of no plan to make
'em stop, Ambrose, bein's as you've always had
a kind of way with women?"</p>

<p>Ambrose shook his head, his homely face lined
with sympathy. Poor Miner was unconscious
of his own change of attitude toward the interloper,
but surely he must not be turned back
from the land of romance within whose gracious
habitations Ambrose himself could never again
hope to dwell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see just what I kin do with the
women," he was obliged to confess after a moment
of hard thinking, "still ef we keep studyin'
and studyin' no doubt we kin find a way."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FEMALE DELEGATION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no question&mdash;Susan Barrows inspired
and headed the female delegation which
early the next morning sallied forth to the district
schoolhouse to call on Miss Dunham.
Also, there was no doubt in the minds of any of
its members before their call was made that the
Yankee teacher would hastily retreat as soon
as she understood that the ladies of Pennyroyal
did not desire her presence among them
and, furthermore, would not have it. However,
of the result of their visit no one was informed
during the ensuing hours of that day.</p>

<p>It was evening, before dark and yet some little
time after supper, when Ambrose, ruminating
on his back kitchen steps and worrying over the
present situation, heard a noise of pots and pans
that sounded like a skirmish of light artillery
proceeding from his neighbour's house next door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
So purposely assuming the expression of innocent
solemnity that seemed most to inflame Mrs.
Susan, he cautiously stepped across from his
back yard to hers. On the door stoop he discovered
Susan Jr., who, as the occupant of a hard
chair, had both white stockinged legs stuck rebelliously
out before her and, resting on her spinal
column, held "Fox's Book of Martyrs" open in
her lap. However, she was <i>not</i> reading it.</p>

<p>Sensing his approach before ever he could
speak, Mrs. Barrows made an immediate appearance.
She had a saucepan in her hand and
her black eyes were wary. They were well
matched adversaries, she and Ambrose, and,
although already understanding perfectly the
object of his visit, some time must pass before
the one or the other could be forced into a surrender.</p>

<p>"Raisin' children is killin' work, Ambrose,"
Susan began at once, darting a direful glance at
her offspring.</p>

<p>And Ambrose's voice was honey: "Most
anythin's killin' work, ain't it, Susan?" he returned,
depositing himself on the floor of her
stoop so that his long legs overhung the side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
allowing his feet to touch the ground. "I've
heard of folks lyin' in bed and doin' nothin' but
singin' psa'ms continuous, and yet comin' to the
same end."</p>

<p>"It's a lot peacefuller way." Mrs. Barrows'
interest was now so plainly concentrated within
her saucepan, whirling a kitchen towel around
and around in it until its revolutions were fairly
dizzying, that nothing could seem more remote
from the remarks and behaviour of herself and
her neighbour than any introduction of the subject
uppermost in both their minds.</p>

<p>However, Susan Jr. did not belong to that
noble army whose lives were at the present
instant recorded in her lap, for, shutting up
"The Book of Martyrs," she sniffed:</p>

<p>"I didn't do nothin' but laugh and tell the female
delegation about the King with his ten
thousand men who marched up a hill and then
marched down again," she explained.</p>

<p>And in the face of this information what was
the use of either Mrs. Barrows or Ambrose trying
further to avoid the issue? The time had
come for a voluntary surrender.</p>

<p>"She won't go, or at least she says she won't,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
though there ain't no use in me tellin' you,
Ambrose, bein's as from Susan Jr.'s words you've
already guessed," Susan struck in. "But when
we ladies got out to the district school this mornin'
in the bilin' sun, what do you think, that girl
came a-runnin' out to meet us a-wavin' her hand
and smilin' and pretendin' she believed we'd
come to welcome her to 'Pennyrile.' And then
before any of us ladies could speak and tell her
our errand, why, she began showin' us around
the old school-house and sayin' she knew we
would understand, 'cause we were women too,
how hard things would be for her if we didn't
help her, until most of the delegates either
plumb forgot the reason of our visitation or else
was too skeered to speak up. It wasn't so with
me!"</p>

<p>Susan paused for a reply, but her neighbour
continued his unusual silence, the while pensively
engaged in studying the toe of his boot.
Coming farther out on to her porch, Mrs. Barrows'
belligerent black curls fluttered like a war
banner in the breeze.</p>

<p>"Course we women knowed you men tried to
make this Miss Em'ly Dunham go, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
wouldn't, but women ain't so easy turned from
things they sets out to do. So I told her we
didn't want no Yankee school teacher in our district,
that we were talkin' things over and meant
to get some one to teach our little darkies ourselves.
And that our intention in comin' forth
to see her had not been to say howdy, but good-bye."</p>

<p>Here the joy of battle, even though it had resulted
in defeat, actually spread a retrospective
glow over the mind of the speaker, for, with her
saucepan resting on her one hip and her dishcloth
on the other, she was forgetting her work
in the glory of narration.</p>

<p>"What do you think that girl done when I said
them last words to her, Ambrose? She put her
head down on the doctor's wife's bosom, bein's
as she had more'n the rest of us, and actually
shed tears, said she thought that the war was
over, and wouldn't we let her stay on for a time
until mebbe we'd like her better. And at this
the ladies was so outdone they kind of scurried
off without gettin' down to anything definite.
But I fixed up matters on the way home. I
told 'em that if Miss Dunham wouldn't go polite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fer the askin', why, 'Pennyrile' could try and
see what freezin' out would do, so there ain't
a single woman or girl in this here town goin' to
exchange the time of day with that girl, ask her
to come in and set fer a spell or even bow to her
on the street."</p>

<p>Still Ambrose remained silent. He knew that
Mrs. Barrows was not unkind, but that she loved
a fight for its own dramatic sake, and yet what
could he do or say to her now that would not by
the very force of opposition make things worse
for Miner's romance?</p>

<p>Susan was growing restless, for she was missing
the clash of steel that usually came from the
striking of her neighbour's against hers.</p>

<p>"One of the ladies said we was boycottin',"
she concluded, showing plain evidences of her
wish to retire into her own home for the night;
"seemed kind of foolish to me, bein's as there
ain't so much as a boy in it."</p>

<p>Perforce Ambrose had now to withdraw.
And yet he said nothing, although as he moved
slowly across her side yard Susan thought she
heard him mutter: "I was a stranger and you
took me in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Sternly then she ordered her offspring to bed,
but, before following her, lingered until the last
vestige of her visitor's coat-tail had disappeared,
when in feminine fashion she had the final words:</p>

<p>"I reckon it's a good thing we ain't all took in
so easy as Ambrose Thompson."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>
"The tides of love and laughter run<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Increasing aye from sun to sun."</span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> could have been more characteristic
of Ambrose Thompson than his sudden decision
to have a second look at Miss Emily Dunham.
Several days had passed since his conversation
with Mrs. Barrows, and village information had
given definite assurance that her plan for freezing
out the Yankee schoolmistress was being
put into execution. And, although little else
had had place in Ambrose's mind, so far he had
not been able to think out a plan of salvation.</p>

<p>It was curious, however, the effect that the
thought of a possible love affair for Miner had
had upon him. Actually after their talk under
the apple tree his step grew lighter, there was
more of the boyhood spring to it, and the stoop
in his shoulders that had showed after Sarah's
passing certainly became less apparent; even his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
smile unconsciously offered more encouragement
to well-meant feminine sympathizers in Pennyroyal.
For such was this tall man's love of romance
that the music of it sounding for another
had awakened his own vibrations. Also he had almost
driven Miner crazy in his repeated efforts to
blow on whatever he considered signs of smouldering
passion in his friend until one afternoon,
when Miner had fairly pushed him from the
shop in order to have peace, coming home to his
empty cottage and feeling a sudden horror of its
loneliness, he had set out for the log cabin. A
vision of Miss Dunham, a meeting, or possibly
a conversation with her, doubtless would add
the spur his imagination needed in her defence.
For poor Ambrose was blind to the fact that he
had any interest but Miner's before him, exquisitely
unaware that he had lately been growing
weary of his own deserted altar and the life of
high abnegation he had planned for himself,
although once or twice he had wondered, if he
lived to so great an age as fifty, how he could
possibly endure so many lonely evenings.</p>

<p>July in Kentucky brings a swift maturity.
Already ears of corn were full ripe in their sheaths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and the other grain bowed by its own abundance.
Yet Ambrose took little of his accustomed interest
in the landscape. Rapidly he walked in
spite of the heat and as rapidly evolved and set
aside his plans for aiding Miner and Miss Dunham.
He knew his own people; the girl had
been sent into Pennyroyal by the Freedmen's
Bureau, a product of the Civil War hated by
most Southerners; and while Pennyroyal might
not mean to be cruel, her pride and clannishness
had no parallel outside of early Scottish history.
And, in spite of Kentucky's far-famed hospitality,
truly there is no other place in the world
where an outsider may be made to feel so outside.</p>

<p>Finally when he had come to the edge of the
clearing and could see the log school-house ahead,
Ambrose was weary, and so sat down on the
stump of a tree. He should have preferred to
go boldly to Miss Dunham's door and ask that
she talk with him, but while his courage had carried
him thus far, the recollection of his first
visit to her halted him at this spot. Surely the
girl would some time come to her door or else be
taking a walk through the woods, for the papaw
grove of small slender trees was thickly shaded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cool and still, many of the birds that earlier inhabited
it having flown farther north, while for
those which remained behind it was a season of
home responsibilities.</p>

<p>How long Ambrose waited and watched he did
not know, since time is of so little importance to
a lonely man, and, moreover, he possessed a long
and beautiful patience with men and things,
even with that Providence whose ways are past
finding out. Only once did anything happen to
encourage him, and then some one did come out
of the school-house door to look toward the setting
sun, but she proved to be the coloured woman
who was Miss Dunham's sole guardian and
caretaker. Still Ambrose managed to keep
cheerful, when unexpectedly and without warning
a dreadful change came over him. His
head sank upon his chest, his delicate nose quivered,
and boyish tears sprang up in his eyes.
And this change was brought about in the oddest
fashion. Ambrose had been idly carving
his own initials in the stump of the tree where he
sat, when all of a sudden it was borne in upon him
that this was the first time in his life that he had
ever carved his own initials without some girl's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to entwine with them. And this brought such a
longing for Sarah that Ambrose straightway
forgot both Miner and Miner's cause, remembering
only his own loss and the single plate and cup
and saucer that must be waiting for him on his
supper table at home.</p>

<p>"Lord," Ambrose whispered, "I'm all in."
Then leaping up from his seat he started running,
running away from the thought of himself.
He must have appeared rather like an animated
scarecrow with his straw-coloured hair, his long
arms flopping and his legs covering such stretches
of ground that his coat-tails stood out straight
behind, for in deference to a possible meeting
with a young woman Ambrose was wearing the
swallow tail and carrying the stove-pipe hat of
his wedding journey.</p>

<p>He stopped, however, when the mouth of an
old war pistol was suddenly placed in front of
his left shoulder.</p>

<p>"Please don't move," its owner said tremulously.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 259px;"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
<img src="images/i-127.jpg" width="259" height="400" alt="&quot;He stopped when the mouth of an old war pistol was suddenly placed in front of his shoulder&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;He stopped when the mouth of an old war pistol was suddenly placed in front of his shoulder&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>And Ambrose's lips twitched as he answered
politely, "I ain't a-goin' to," and then he kept absolutely
still, noticing that the arm that held the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
pistol was trembling nervously and that the girl
at the end of the arm wore a yellow sunbonnet
and a primrose covered dress, and that the face
within the sunbonnet was possibly a shade paler
and more startled than his own.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I frightened you," she apologized
after a little further study of her companion,
"but I am so often alone in these woods and now
that the war is just over and things so unsettled
I thought it best to carry my father's pistol, and
you startled me so running toward me."</p>

<p>Ambrose inclined his head, not daring to
make any further move, for the girl still held
her pistol so confidingly near the neighbourhood
of his heart; nevertheless, he was able to see that
Miss Dunham had changed since the day of her
visit to their shop. Her eyes were bright, but
the laughter lines had disappeared from her
mouth and chin, and while she still meant to be
firm, the man could see that the firmness cost.</p>

<p>Her pistol drooped listlessly downward. "You
must not mind; it isn't loaded," she explained,
"and even if it were, I couldn't shoot."</p>

<p>But still she handled the weapon in so ingenuous
and distinctly feminine a manner that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Ambrose reached out. "You wouldn't mind
my having a look, Miss Dunham?" Emptying
the barrels, a single shot slid into his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," cried the girl helplessly, "I am so
sorry; I might have killed you." Then she
wavered for a moment and except for Ambrose's
arm might have fallen. The yellow
sunlight bathed her and her dress in a golden
light. It was a curious thing for the tall man to
have a woman's eyes so nearly on a level with
his own, though she righted herself almost instantly
and taking off her sunbonnet began making
odd pats at her hair as girls so frequently
do after almost every upsetting situation.</p>

<p>"I didn't faint, I never have fainted in my
life," she explained indignantly. "I did feel a
little sick, because as I didn't know my pistol
was loaded I might so easily have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so," Ambrose answered gravely, and
then without rhyme or reason both of them
laughed, not just for an instant, but for the longest
time, as though one of the funniest things in
the world had just taken place; and afterward,
without asking permission, Ambrose walked back
with the girl to the log cabin. He would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
gone home immediately, then, but at her door
Emily turned to him with hot cheeks like a child
longing to make a request and yet afraid.</p>

<p>"Would you mind staying and talking to me
for a little?" she begged at length. "You see,
it seems to me I haven't laughed for such a
long while, and I like to laugh so much."</p>

<p>And Ambrose's face quivered in its old sympathetic
fashion. "Course I will," he almost
added "honey," but stopped himself in time. "Ef
you and I can set a while on this bench by the
door I wouldn't be a mite surprised ef we couldn't
think up some way to make livin' in 'Pennyrile'
a heap more of a laughin' matter for you."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE REVELATION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this it was extraordinary the number
of absolutely unassailable reasons that kept
Ambrose so frequently on his way back and
forth from the village to the school-house. Certainly
twenty-four hours rarely passed without
his getting up a wholly new idea to assist Miss
Dunham, and therefore Miner, about which it
was necessary to ask her advice. And possibly
Emily encouraged him in this, for often she had
postponed or put aside a perfectly good suggestion
with the proposition that they talk the question
over later, and that Ambrose come out again
to the log cabin to see if they were of the same
mind.</p>

<p>Of course Ambrose was extremely particular
not to permit the hours of his visits to conflict
with those of his partner, but as Miner no longer
spent his evenings with him, naturally he concluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that these evenings were devoted to Emily,
and therefore his appearances were usually made
during the long summer twilight. And this not
with any idea of hiding or of disloyalty, but
simply that he should not be in his friend's
way; for Ambrose's heart was singularly light
these days and the sun shone with its old
glory. Why, even the one little cloud that had
troubled him for a while had been with laughter
pushed away. On his mind during the first of
his two or three visits had been the thought that
Miss Dunham could not know of his presence in
the midnight raid.</p>

<p>They were in the woods together one evening,
a little beyond the papaw thicket, when Ambrose,
thrusting his hand into his pocket, drew forth a
carefully wrapped up package. "It ain't a present;
it's yours already," he announced, pushing
it toward Emily with his face crimsoning, and
digging his toes into the earth like a big, awkward
boy.</p>

<p>Slowly the girl unfolded her lost hairbrush,
and, though her eyes immediately shone with
laughter, womanlike she kept her lids down,
asking with a kind of over-emphasized wonder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"How on earth, Mr. Ambrose Thompson, could
you ever have come upon my hairbrush?"</p>

<p>And in another moment Ambrose had confessed
everything of his own part in the raid, told
his story miserably and without extenuating circumstances,
and ending with the statement that
he couldn't endure to have her friendship until
she knew the full extent of his unmanliness.</p>

<p>Then Emily allowed herself to look straight
at him and her laughter brimmed over. "Why,
I've known all along," she whispered, putting
her hand for just the briefest, comforting second
over the top of his. "Don't you suppose that I
recognized the voice coming from the longest
shadow I ever saw as soon as I saw the longest
man in Pennyroyal?"</p>

<p>Two weeks afterward it happened as usual
that Miner and Ambrose were both in their shop
closing up for the night, but, what was most remarkable,
Miner was allowing Ambrose to do
the greater part of the work, and for fifteen minutes
had been sitting on the top of a vinegar
barrel idly whittling at a stick and every once
in a while clearing his throat as though he were
getting ready to speak, notwithstanding he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
kept his face turned from the sight of his
partner.</p>

<p>"Looks like Miss Dunham's gettin' more
cheerfuller lately," he blurted at last, not glancing
up, but whittling so briskly that the chips
about him on the floor looked like the shorn
curls of a lamb.</p>

<p>Ambrose lifted his face from the depth of a
large ledger where he had been laboriously writing
down the day's accounts. "Yes, ain't she?"
he returned happily; "seems like she's sorter
too big to be hurt by other folk's meannesses."
Then walking across the shop he laid his hand on
his friend's shoulder with a gesture that was
almost a caress.</p>

<p>"You been goin' out to see her yourself considerable
lately, ain't you? So mebbe she ain't
needin' much other comp'ny," Miner suggested,
raising his eyes and then lowering them quickly
before the other man could catch his glance.</p>

<p>Ambrose hesitated. "Why, mebbe I have,"
he confessed slowly; "funny I ain't ever thought
of it in that light! You see I've been a-tryin' to
do what you asked and hatch up some scheme
to make 'Pennyrile' understand and like Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Dunham better, but Em'ly and me ain't come
to any conclusion yet that's good enough, so I
reckon that's why I keep on a-goin'."</p>

<p>"Em'ly!" Miner sprung off his barrel top like
he had been struck. "So it's come to that, has
it?" And by this time his sneer and anger were
so unmistakable that his companion, whose expression
had been perfectly frank a moment before,
turned a dull red and for the first time in his
life his eyes dropped before those of his friend.</p>

<p>"I ain't callin' her Em'ly to her face, Miner,
at least not more'n once or twice," he answered
painfully, feeling himself turn hot and cold in
the same instant, and an awful weight settle itself
upon his chest. Then a relieved light broke
over him. "Mebbe now I'm thinkin' upon her
as Em'ly because some day you and she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Liar!" The little man, blinded with passion,
struck out somewhere into the region of
his friend's chest and, when Ambrose caught his
hands and held them, twisted and growled like a
little dog in the grasp of a big one, repeating
over and over in a thick voice, "Liar, liar, you
know you want her for yourself, you know you
love her, so what damn use is there in you pretendin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
before me?" until his rage had partly
spent itself.</p>

<p>Ambrose had made no sort of answer or defence;
indeed, his big hands had seemed to cling
to Miner rather than to restrain him, besides
which there was something in his appearance
that would have made it hard to continue angry
with him even if you had not loved him.</p>

<p>"I didn't know, Miner," he said at last,
hushed and frightened, "I didn't know until you
spoke it. I reckon I do love her, but now I
know I won't see or speak with her no more."</p>

<p>Then when Miner had banged his way out of
the store the tall man, sitting down on the deserted
barrel, began to shake, and there was
shame on his face and the look of a man who has
suddenly heard that the ship on which he is sailing
must go down. For several hours he remained
in his shop, sometimes walking up and
down and then reseating himself on the barrel,
but wherever he went and whatever he did old
Moses dragged his rheumatic legs after him.
Two or three times the man patted the dog, whispering
reassuringly, "It's all right; don't you be
worryin' none about me, old fellow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was so dark in the shop that when Mrs.
Barrows, carrying a lantern, opened the door she
could not at first find Ambrose. And afterward,
when he did come toward her and her light fell
full upon his face, to Susan's eternal credit let it
be set down that she turned away her eyes.</p>

<p>"You come along home, Ambrose Thompson,"
she began sternly; "ain't I been watchin'
and waitin' for you to go by to your supper these
past two hours? It's mighty nigh time I was
gittin' to bed and I ain't able to sleep less'n my
mind's easy."</p>

<p>Taking the man by the arm she led him toward
home, talking in a tone that few persons
had ever heard from Susan. "Whatever's happened
to you to-day, Ambrose Thompson, don't
you be scaired," she said once. "I tell you it's
the folks that things never happen to that ought
to be scaired, 'cause you're livin' and they ain't."
And then when Ambrose would have left her at
her gate, climbing up the few steps that led into
her yard she was able thus to place her hands on
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ambrose," she said then, "there was a neighbour
remarked to me the other day, 'Ain't Ambrose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Thompson changed a lot since his wife
died?' I told her, 'No, folks don't change none
in what I calls their fundamentals. They alter
some; of course learnin' life don't mean to make
no exception of them with troubles, but leopards
don't stripe, nor zebras spot, nor human bein's
get made over by experiences. You been livin'
lately thinkin' you was changed entirely inside
by Sarah's death, but you ain't changed&mdash;you've
just been restin'. You've seen other folks git
over things that hit 'em as hard as Sarah's dyin'
done you, but course you thought <i>you</i> were
differ'nt." Leaning over, Susan gave Ambrose
a peck certainly intended as a kiss. "It's awful
hard, boy, to wake up sometimes, after one has
been adreamin', but I reckon you're wakin' up."</p>

<p>Susan was correct, Ambrose's dream had
passed and by morning no mists of it remained.
Since the revelation of Miner's accusation in the
shop he had made no effort at self-deception,
understanding now why since his meeting with
the Yankee school teacher his world had been
again so strangely vivid, so full of adventure,
that even his trips back and forth to the shop had
been filled with delightful impressions, ideas that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
might some day be confided to her. For, after
all, is there not so much of life in the smallest
place in this world when you are fully alive in it,
and so little in the biggest when you are not?</p>

<p>Then the bitterest part of Ambrose's fight was
that he knew Emily to be his real mate, knew
that Sarah had been a boy's spring fancy, but
that the summer had now set the seal of her
warmth and fruition upon his second love.
Moreover, he also knew that Emily might be
made to care for him, since love like his is rarely
without its answer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when dawn came he had written
this letter and taken it out to the post:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Dunham</span>: I've got to quit comin' to see
you and I can't say why, except it's best.</p>

<p>Then I haven't got the old reason, for to-night it's come
to me the way to make Pennyroyal not treat you so bad.
Can't you give out that you're sick, for if only the Pennyroyal
ladies can get the chance to take care of you they'll
be real pleased. Seems like letting people do good things
for you is the surest way to make them quit doing mean;
it's kind of human nature.</p>

<p>And there is one other thing I'd like to say to you: It's
about Miner; he's a whole lot bigger than he looks and there
can't no man on earth beat him at loving if you'll only help
him a little at the start.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Ambrose Thompson, Esq.</span><br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an odd, stiff letter, and yet that afternoon
when Emily had received it she laughed
and placed it inside the folds of her primrose
dress; although a moment afterward she sighed
with the thought of the lonely hour before
sunset.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FOLLOWING HIS ADVICE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">No further</span> reference was made to the difference
between the two friends, but Ambrose had
reason to believe a few days later that Miss Dunham
was following his advice; for coming out in
his yard before breakfast, after a restless night,
he was just in time to spy Mrs. Barrows climbing
into the gig with Doctor Webb, carrying a basket
on her arm and wearing so glorified an expression
that it could come of nothing but the
opportunity of ministering to the sick. For the
care of the sick gave to Susan the same glow of
pleasure that the act of creation gives to the
artist or the command of his army gives the born
general. Once stationed by the bedside of a
patient, was she not the main source from which
news of the illness must flow as well as the basin
into which all inquiries must be poured? Certainly
Ambrose had so considered her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, that afternoon his suspicion was
justified by Miner's growling at him over the
opening of a new hogshead of molasses: "Miss
Dunham's powerful poorly," and then going on
furiously with his work as though he had never
spoken.</p>

<p>And Ambrose did not dare ask questions nor
prolong the subject of their conversation, though
wistful to hear that Miner as well as Emily
approved his plan. However, there was little
doubt of its success, for the turning of the tide in
favour of the Yankee schoolmistress soon could
be seen, heard, and felt. Rivers of soup were
made to flow toward the once anathematized
cabin, and mountains of sponge cake and jelly
were dumped at its door.</p>

<p>Since the day of the first visit there had
always been in Pennyroyal a small number of
women headed by Mrs. Dr. Webb who were not
so manifestly unfavourable to Emily, but according
to report they had lately been most unmercifully
snubbed and put down by Mrs. Barrows,
who would allow no one else inside the cabin and
actually barred other ministering angels from
the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Hearing word of the approach of these ladies
one morning through Emily's coloured maid,
Susan came forth into the clearing to meet them
and stood waiting as usual with one hand resting
on each sharp hip. Then before any other
mouth could be opened hers was at work.</p>

<p>"I am powerful glad, Maria Webb, that you
have had a change of heart toward the poor
young girl," she commenced, "but you needn't
try now to be gettin' inside her home after havin'
so long kep' her out of your own. Besides, she's
too sick to see no one 'cept the doctor and me.
Doctor Webb says she's real ill with chills and
fever 'cause papaw trees won't flourish 'ceptin'
where it's damp, but I call it human ague the
child's got. Talkin' about millstones hung about
your neck, they're necklaces compared to the
way women tries to drag down other women
when they start in to do something a mite
different."</p>

<p>And this intense irritation of Mrs. Barrows
showing itself thus to her female friends even
extended to her comparatively favoured next
door neighbour, although Ambrose could not understand
the cause. Emily of course had taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Susan into her confidence and she was a natural
dramatist and yet why should she positively
glare at him one evening as he stood snipping
the dead stalks from the rose bushes in his yard?</p>

<p>Indeed her disapproval was so evident that
Ambrose straightening up asked in amazement:
"Whatever have I done, Susan?"</p>

<p>"Ain't it about time you was inquirin' concernin'
Miss Dunham?" Susan demanded; "you're
'most the only person now in Pennyrile that
ain't, and ef there's one thing I more'n another
nacherally despise it's folks proppin' up a thing
when it's standin' firm and don't need help, and
then beginnin' to ease off when mebbe it's likely
to fall."</p>

<p>"How is Miss Dunham?" Ambrose queried,
and the older woman gave him a curious look.
"She ain't dyin' sick yet, Doctor Webb says,
but it's worse 'n he thought, 'cause it ain't plain
chills and fever; mebbe it's the typhoids."</p>

<p>At this information Ambrose paled slightly,
but when his neighbour had disappeared into
her house for fresh clothes and supplies his expression
grew more peaceful.</p>

<p>"Em'ly's turnin' out a lot better actress 'n I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
thought," he said to himself. "I wasn't figurin'
on her play actin' so long."</p>

<p>He was leaning on his rake, having suddenly
lost every atom of energy, when Susan, passing
out again, dealt him another blow.</p>

<p>"Ain't you never goin' to stop mopin', Ambrose
Thompson? I'm sick of lookin' at you," she
said. "Seems like there's nothin' on this earth
more tryin' than the way some folks act dead
'cause some one they love is. Ef the Lord
hadn't wanted you to live, man, I reckon He'd
'a' took you with Sarah. 'Tain't likely He
wants dead folks on His livin' earth!" And
then Mrs. Barrows hurried away to her charge,
having left behind her sufficient inspiration to
persuade Ambrose to finish the task of tidying
up his yard.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 236px;"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>
<img src="images/i-146.jpg" width="236" height="400" alt="&quot;Ain&#39;t you never goin&#39; to stop mopin&#39;, Ambrose Thompson? I&#39;m sick of lookin&#39; at you&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Ain&#39;t you never goin&#39; to stop mopin&#39;, Ambrose Thompson? I&#39;m sick of lookin&#39; at you&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>And so another week went by, Ambrose and
Miner in the meanwhile having less to say to
each other than at any time in their lives since
they had learned to speak, and never meeting
any more outside of working hours. Nevertheless
when they were together, although Miner's
manner continued surly and unapproachable, his
eyes constantly watched the face of his former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
friend, while Ambrose never altered in his old
attitude of affection toward him.</p>

<p>Yet on Sunday morning, as Ambrose stood
dressing for church in front of his yellow pine
bureau, without warning his bedroom door suddenly
opened and in stalked Miner. Grave
and silent he waited, until when the meeting
bell sounded, he started forth to church, leaning
as of old on the arm of his friend, and entering
his pew sat down beside him.</p>

<p>Ambrose did not pay a great deal of attention
to the beginning of the service that day; on coming
in he noticed that Susan and Doctor Webb
were not in their accustomed places, but afterward
he seemed always to have been listening to
the August hum of the bees just outside the
raised window on his side of the pew. Through
it he could also see the deep rose of the ripening
pink clover fields, smell their almost overpowering
sweetness, till with the weight on
his chest which he never shook off these days he
wondered if Emily, who loved the outdoors as he
did, was not by this time weary of feigning illness.</p>

<p>Then Brother Bibbs so changed the order of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the usual Sunday routine that it must have startled
Ambrose into consciousness. The elderly
man had finished his sermon, but instead of at
once announcing the closing hymn to be followed
by the benediction, he stood clearing his
throat, his little worn face paling with emotion.</p>

<p>"Brether'n and sister'n," he began slowly,
"there be faith, hope and charity, these three
things, but the greatest of these is charity. I
want you now to fall on your knees with me and
pray for the life of the young woman lately come
into our midst whom we, like the Pharisees of
old, have tried to cast out. I want you to pray
for that young Yankee school teacher, Miss
Emily Dunham, because she is powerful sick,
and if the good Lord takes her to Him, I don't
see just how we are coming out with the greatest
of these three things."</p>

<p>While the rest of the congregation were falling
upon their knees Ambrose somehow got himself
out of the church, nor did he realize during the
moment of his leaving that Miner was there hanging
on to his arm. After a time, however, when
both men were walking toward the log cabin,
he turned to his friend, whispering brokenly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't know she was sick really, Miner. I
thought she was just play actin' same as I asked
her to."</p>

<p>And Miner nodded. "My fault. I suspicioned
your ignorance, but I ain't been able to
break it. Em'ly told me of your letter soon as
it come. She hadn't been feelin' any too well
before then, though she'd sort 'er been hidin'
it, and afterward she kep' a-gettin' worse and
worse."</p>

<p>When finally they had come near the cabin,
Ambrose sat down on the selfsame stump where
he had waited so long for Emily on the afternoon
of their first meeting, and since he would not go
inside the house Miner went in without him,
promising to bring back news. However, several
hours passed and Miner did not return; Ambrose
saw Doctor Webb leave the house, stay away
half an hour and then go back into it and remain
there. Then afterward Brother Bibbs followed
him in, and Mrs. Webb and a dozen or more
Pennyroyal townsfolk appeared clustering in a
hushed group near the little schoolhouse door.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the waiting time did not seem
long to Ambrose Thompson, since he was living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
over every moment he had ever spent with Emily,
hearing the sound of her laughter, feeling the
touch of her hand over his, and then remembering
how he had wondered in the days since his
surrender whether it would not have been easier
for him to have given her up through death.</p>

<p>It was dusk when Miner laid his hand on
Ambrose's arm; he had not seen the little man's
approach.</p>

<p>"It's past, the crisis," Miner said huskily;
"she's better and has been askin' for you."</p>

<p>Then Ambrose rose, but he didn't move in the
direction of the cabin; instead, he began running
toward home, Miner having difficulty in keeping
up with him. And it was hearing Miner's hard
breathing behind that finally made him slow up.</p>

<p>"I couldn't 'a' gone to her, Miner," he explained.
"Can't you see, ef I should 'a' seen
her lyin' there so white and helpless I couldn't
'a' helped takin' her in my arms and tellin' her I
loved her. No man kin bear it when it looks
like the woman he loves is needin' him."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LIGHT IN DARKNESS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Afterward</span>, when the two men had parted
for the night, Miner went directly to his home,
and there in his usual methodical fashion undressed
and got himself into bed, although all
the time his dark face was twisting and working,
his mouth dry, while the mind of the man had
no knowledge of what his hands were doing.
For Miner, without understanding it, was alone
on his high mountain where every man must
stand who knows what it is to desire and to surrender.
So what does it matter that his mountain
was the attic bedroom of a cottage and that
the little man who wrestled with the devil stood
but five feet two in his stocking feet and weighed
only a hundred and five pounds, or even that his
"Get thee behind me, Satan," was so differently
put?</p>

<p>Because when Miner's fight was over he merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
said: "I ain't never been at all certain in my
mind that I could love a woman, so more'n
likely I've all along been mistaken 'bout Em'ly.
Seems like there ain't but one mortal thing on
this earth I am sure on and that's&mdash;Ambrose!"</p>

<p>And yet the little man recalled nothing of the
story of David and Jonathan, and, even if he
had, could never have appreciated how their
story touched his.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was one thing to decide to
make a sacrifice of himself and his love to his
friend, and quite a different thing to persuade
that friend to accept it. For some time poor
Miner puzzled; Ambrose would not even go out
to the log cabin during the period of Emily's
convalescence, though getting daily reports of
her condition through him and through Doctor
Webb. Susan Barrows, for some unexplainable
reason, absolutely declined to speak to her next
door neighbour when, after the period of her
nursing was over, she had once more returned
home.</p>

<p>There were harassed hours when unwittingly
Miner came near to laying the case before Ambrose,
being so accustomed, in all other matters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
requiring imagination, to relying on that of his
friend. It is all very well to think that he might
just have plainly stated his own change of mind
and heart, but measuring the extent of the renunciation
by what it would have meant to him,
so surely Ambrose would never have accepted
his sacrifice.</p>

<p>No, some more ingenious method must be devised,
and Hamlet did not devote more agony to
discovering a plan for avenging his father's
death than Miner to finding a way of new life for
Ambrose.</p>

<p>One afternoon the little man was limping
slowly along the dusty August turnpike leading
out from Pennyroyal with Moses, who, feeling
his need, had accompanied him, yet, now too stiff
to walk far, was being carried in his arms, when
the attention of both the man and dog were arrested
by the spectacle of an old darky trying
to drive a mule, hitched to a wagonload of green-corn,
into Pennyroyal, the mule having at this
point positively declined to go farther.</p>

<p>It was inspiration in a strange guise, and yet
inspiration must necessarily come to us in the
character of the events that make up our lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The darky coaxed and threatened and beat
his willow switch bare of leaves; the mule,
spreading her legs to the four corners of the
globe, remained firm. By and by the negro got
down from his seat and with Miner's aid gathered
a small pile of chips, which, with a piece of paper,
were placed under the mule and set fire to.
Then an instant later, when the mule started
trotting amiably off toward Pennyroyal, Miner's
heart began singing its own peculiar anthem of
thankfulness, and immediately afterward he
hurried off for a visit to Emily at the log cabin.</p>

<p>On coming back to the shop so changed was
his expression and so cleared his look of doubt
that Ambrose, feeling sure Emily had just accepted
him, wished to God Miner would confide
in him and so let his darkest hour be lived
through.</p>

<p>But Miner said nothing then. However,
when his regular hour came around once more
he appeared taking his accustomed chair next
his friend's under the apple tree in his yard.
And yet here Miner still continued mute, although
moving about far more restlessly than
usual, while Ambrose, patiently waiting for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to speak, felt the sharpness of his earlier desire
succeeded by a kind of apathy. Finally at some
little distance off a clock in a church tower struck
eight.</p>

<p>"My foot itches to-night, Ambrose," Miner
announced suddenly.</p>

<p>"Shake it," advised his listener, whose mind
was certainly on a far different line of thought.</p>

<p>But Miner, only squirming and twisting about
the more, complained:</p>

<p>"Seems like it's one of them things that can't
be shook off. I was just a-thinkin' it might be
better to go for a walk than to sit here so
eternal."</p>

<p>And here Ambrose, feeling that the little man
would never get out his confession to-night,
sighed: "Suit yourself, ef you like walking better.
I reckon I kin make out the rest of the
evening alone."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Miner did not stir. Instead, taking
another bite at a fresh plug of tobacco, he
chewed on it fiercely for a moment longer. "I
was aimin' for you to come with me," he said,
"bein's as you know I ain't able to git on too
well with this lame leg."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The soft summer night stirred in Ambrose no
inclination for movement, and indeed far rather
would he have been alone and undisturbed, yet
now getting up slowly, lifting his great height
in sections, he offered his arm to his friend.</p>

<p>Then the two men started off together, walking
far more rapidly than usual on a summer
night's stroll, for Miner seemed to have forgotten
his lameness, and the fury of his spirit rushed
them both ahead. Every now and then, furtively,
he kept feeling in his back pocket, but
the tall man did not notice him nor was he for
some time aware in what direction he was being
led.</p>

<p>A half moon shone in the sky, and the night
was clear and still.</p>

<p>Then suddenly at a turn in a country road
Ambrose abruptly halted, letting his companion's
arm slide from his own. For at this turn
in the road to the end of his life must Ambrose
Thompson wake to consciousness, since from
here in the daylight could be seen the first
glimpse of the log schoolhouse, and though not
visible by night its spiritual presence was the
plainer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't goin' with you to Em'ly's to-night,
Miner," Ambrose declared quietly; "it's more'n
I kin stand and more'n you've the right to ask.
I wasn't countin' on you tryin' to outwit me."
The words were spoken with only reasonable reproach,
and yet the little man turned on the
speaker fiercely.</p>

<p>"You jist wait here, Ambrose Thompson, till
I git back, and keep on waitin' in the same place,
for ef you don't I'll never forgive you, God
knows." And off trotted Miner toward the cabin,
until his small form was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Of course Ambrose waited, it having always
been his custom to give way to Miner in small
things, and, as he had grown unaccountably
weary, stretched himself full length on the
ground, and there a moment later the man felt
himself in the grip of the primal instinct that all
big men and some big women know. His will
kept his long clean body still, yet everything else
in him called out the strong man's right over the
weak. The earth that mothered him proved it
in all her moods. And yet there only a few
paces ahead of him Miner was holding Emily
in his arms. One swift rush and&mdash;here Ambrose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
checked his vision, for he would not stir one
foot.</p>

<p>Therefore, at first, the slight crackling noise
at some little distance off made no impression
upon him, but almost at once and without his
own volition his long, sensitive nose sniffed the
odour of smoke somewhere in the woods. The
next instant a flame shot up in the air and Ambrose
with it, for the flame came directly from
the neighbourhood of Emily's cottage.</p>

<p>"Lord!" murmured Ambrose as he ran,
"Em'ly's house is afire, and she hasn't no one
but a little runt like Miner to look after her."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SURPRISE PARTY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">He Ran</span> straight on into&mdash;Emily.</p>

<p>The girl, having been attracted by the light
back of her cabin, had just come out into her
yard and so saw the impossible figure flying toward
her, and in all the world there was never
but one other man so homely and so beautiful.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought your house was afire," Ambrose
announced huskily.</p>

<p>He had stopped so close to the girl that she
caught both his hands in hers, pressing one for
an instant against her cheek.</p>

<p>"Something <i>is</i> burning in the woods; it doesn't
matter," she answered; "but, oh, Ambrose, you
have been such a long time in coming to me!"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes were shining, her figure perfectly
distinct, and she wore the primrose dress,
yet Ambrose knowing this did not believe he had
dared look at her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't come to you now," he defended
stoutly; "I was just afeard to trust you to Miner
in a fire."</p>

<p>Then Emily laughed the low understanding
laugh that was her greatest charm, and all the
while drawing her companion with her toward
their bench in front of her door, she sat down
beside him, still keeping one hand in his gently
resisting fingers; there seemed to be no fear and
no shyness about Emily to-night; she was too
exquisitely a thing of love.</p>

<p>"Yet you were willing to trust my life and
soul and everything there is about me to Miner,"
she said slowly. "Ah, isn't that like a man!
But, dear, Miner hasn't been near me since early
this afternoon," she continued, "and then he
came for such a funny Miner reason. He wanted
to tell me that if ever I'd thought he had any
leaning toward me, it wasn't in no ways true.
Because so far as <i>he</i> could see there wasn't
nothin' a woman could be or do that could make
up for her troublesomeness."</p>

<p>With this Emily quietly withdrew her hand
and sitting still wondered if Ambrose had even
heard her, for he did not speak at first, yet when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
turning he looked at her, the light of the fire
making his face quite clear, the girl's eyes filled
with tears. "Has it been so bad as that?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>Ambrose nodded. "I ain't ever goin' to be
able to tell you how I love you, honey, but it
seems like everything that has gone before in my
life and is comin' after is done made up fer by
to-night."</p>

<p>Then after a little, when they had talked for a
while and been silent a while longer, Emily put
her head down on Ambrose's shoulder so that he
might not see her face.</p>

<p>"I am thinking about Sarah; every woman
thinks about the other woman some time," she
confessed.</p>

<p>"Little Sarah?" Ambrose waited. "Was
you wantin' me to say I didn't love her, honey?
'cause I can't. Would it 'a' been fairer to you,
I wonder, ef I hadn't had a heart big enough fer
lovin' some one before ever I set eyes on you?
Sarah was young and needed me, and I reckon I
loved her all I was able to <i>then</i>, but there wasn't
so much of me to love her with as there is now.
You see, Em'ly darlin', the dark waters has sort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
'er passed over me, and I ain't in my springtime
no more. Then lovin' and losin' does learn us a
lot: but I ain't never goin' to care fer nobody as
I do fer you, 'cause nobody else'll ever understand
me and match up to me same as you do."
But here Ambrose, sighing, pushed back his
faded straw-coloured hair with the old puzzled
gesture. "Still, honey, ef anything ever happens,
I feel just obleeged to tell you, I reckon
I'm the kind that plumb couldn't live on this
earth without lovin' some one."</p>

<p>For a troubled instant Emily hesitated, and
then with a sympathy so perfect that it was to
last for ever and ever, and with another understanding
laugh, she lifted up her head and kissed
her truthful lover.</p>

<p>So that by and by when the fire in the woods
back of them had died down they were both so
happy that they neither saw nor heard the figure
in the papaw grove stealing along a few yards to
one side of them, though in the darkness of the
tangled thicket it stumbled several times and
for want of a helping arm limped painfully along.</p>

<p>Nevertheless five minutes later Ambrose and
Emily both jumped hurriedly to their feet. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
unexpectedly there sounded a noise as of many
persons approaching the log cabin along the
route which Ambrose had just taken. In another
moment a procession came into sight and
at the head and front walked Mrs. Barrows in
her best purple linsey petticoat and scoop bonnet
and carrying a basket on her arm. Following
her were ten, twenty, thirty or more of the
leading citizens of Pennyroyal, male and female,
attired in their Sunday clothes and bearing
packages.</p>

<p>"It's some kind of a forgiveness party," Ambrose
whispered nervously; "seems like I'd
better hide," and once again he attempted to flatten
his thin body against the wall of the cabin.</p>

<p>Susan Barrows took Emily in her arms.
"We're surprisin' you, child, and I hope we're
pleasant," she explained. "Fer my own part I
ain't never had nothin' happen to me suddint in
my life that ain't been plumb distasteful, so I
argued some with the folks to let you know we
was comin'. But there's people in villages that
finds things so slow and samewise it appears
they think any kind of a start's better then
nothin' happenin', so here we are!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Susan's speech having been somewhat longer
than her neighbours cared to listen to, the men
and women of the party in the meanwhile had
come crowding up around Emily until she had
the sensation of shaking hands with a dozen persons
at once, and all of them were smiling at her
and saying how glad they were to know she was
well again and wouldn't she live always in Pennyroyal,
until Mrs. Barrows was actually thrust
to one side. However, in that instant she managed
to unearth Ambrose, who, appreciating
what was taking place, had thought it best to
step forth out of the shadow. Sheepishly he
extended his hand to his neighbour and in the
moonlight Susan got a good view of his face.</p>

<p>Her eyes snapped. "Good Lord! what a
turn you've done give me!" she exclaimed, and
then taking a closer survey: "Ambrose Thompson,
I ain't more'n halfway suspicioned 'bout
you and Em'ly Dunham before this night, but
ef ever there's a surprise party in this village
when you don't get there first, why I'd like to
know!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THIRTY YEARS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Pennyroyal</span> bore witness to the permanence
of material things untroubled by spirit. Thirty
years had passed since Ambrose Thompson's
last honeymoon, and yet the little town had not
greatly changed.</p>

<p>One afternoon in October, when from the
same double row of linden trees, with only here
and there a fallen comrade, a shower of wrinkled
golden leaves was filling the ruts in the same road
that once held the blossoms of an earlier spring,
the door of a cottage opened and an elderly man
stepped forth, humming a tune and began walking
slowly down toward the front gate. He was
dressed in gala attire and, observing a bed of
purple asters that were growing near his path,
stooped to gather one of the flowers. Getting
up with a groan, he placed a hand on the small
of his back, remarking testily: "Looks like I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
gettin' powerful onlimber these days," and then
jigging stiffly about to disprove his assertion he
placed the aster in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>Pennyroyal was unusually stirred up over
something, for at five o'clock her streets were
filling with people in their best clothes, all moving
toward the same spot&mdash;the new red brick
Baptist church, with a cupola, which stood
where Brother Bibbs's old frame meeting house
had once held place.</p>

<p>A carriage advanced slowly, an open Victoria
drawn by a pair of handsome Kentucky horses
and containing besides the coachman two other
persons, a man and a woman. The man was a
product of an oratorical period in Kentucky; he
had the beak nose, the rolling black eyes, long
hair and heavy forensic shoulders that had already
landed the Hon. Calvin Breckenridge
Jones as representative of the Pennyroyal district
in the State Capitol at Frankfort, while it
was a common supposition that only a lack of
money had kept him from climbing higher. His
companion, the Widow Tarwater, was the richest
widow in the county.</p>

<p>Now as the carriage drew near the man at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
gate, the bow with which he greeted the widow
had in it the dignity and devotion of a benediction.</p>

<p>"Lord, what a woman!" he exclaimed a moment
later in a deliciously rich and reasonable
voice. "Looks like there's some people same as
fruits, they don't noways mellow till age gets
'em."</p>

<p>Then once more lifting his hat, the speaker,
Ambrose Thompson, now a man of almost sixty,
attempted pushing back the hair from his forehead,
apparently forgetting that his hair had
retreated so far backward over his high dome
that the few remaining locks tastefully arranged
in front suggested the ripples left by a receding
wave along a shore. Also his face was deeply
lined and his shoulders stooped considerably, and
yet in spite of these and other signs of age in
some indefinable way Ambrose Thompson had
kept his boyishness. Not having travelled
more than a hundred miles out of Pennyroyal,
nevertheless he had the eternal youthfulness of
spirit which belongs to all life's true adventurers.</p>

<p>"Ambrose Thompson's lookin' powerful spruce
this evenin', ain't he?" A woman of about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
forty, with quick birdlike movements, shrieked
this remark into an ear trumpet which
was being held up by a shrivelled figure in a
wheeled chair that had just been projected forth
from the house next door with such suddenness
that it seemed likely to spill out its feeble occupant.</p>

<p>The old woman's head nodded helplessly, and
yet out of her withered face her black eyes still
shone with an unquenchable fire. At this instant
Ambrose, catching sight of Mrs. Barrows,
blew a kiss across his dividing fence to her, so
that she laughed, before replying, the pleased
monotonous laugh of deafness and old age.</p>

<p>"Ef it's an evergreen spruce you're meanin',
Susan Jr., then you're more'n right, for it seems
Ambrose Thompson's leaves are forever green
and the sap runnin' in him same as spring. But
hurry me along, I don't want to miss nothin'
of this oyster party, and mebbe ef you kin set me
right about in the middle of the new Sunday-school
room, I kin sort er reckon on what's goin'
on."</p>

<p>The two women then moved so rapidly down
the street that they almost ran into a man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was hobbling in the opposite direction leaning
on a cane; his face as dry of any human emotion
as though it had been a squeezed-out dishcloth.
He was attempting to move past the wheeled
chair without speaking, when a claw hand
reached out after him. "Scared of a female
past eighty, Miner Hobbs," the old voice cheered.
"Ain't it a God's blessing no woman has run off
with you&mdash;yet?"</p>

<p>Still at the gate the smile that greeted the approach
of this dried-up little man was as radiant
as the love of a woman.</p>

<p>"It's mortal good of you, Miner, to be goin'
to the oyster show with me to-night, bein's as
how you hate gatherin's," Ambrose began affectionately;
"you've done give up a heap of tastes
fer me first and last, ain't you, old friend? Now
ef you'll wait here for me a few moments longer
I'll be wholly ready to join you, for I kinder
thought I'd like to speak with a few friends before
the supper begins."</p>

<p>Ambrose started hastily back toward his front
door with such an unmistakably jaunty air, such
a forgetting of his rheumatic joints, that Miner's
ferret eyes gleamed upon him suspiciously. Besides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was he not wearing an historic long coat, a
strangely rusty stovepipe hat, and a white
starched shirt over which his large lavender silk
tie was crossed like a breastplate, and was he not
also revealing yards of newly gray trousered
legs?</p>

<p>"You wasn't aimin' to speak to no one in particular,
was ye?" Miner inquired.</p>

<p>The long man stopped, noticeably blushing,
and then, although the rest of his face remained
grave, his eyes twinkled. "S'pose you don't
know, Miner, how hard it is sometimes not to lie
to the folks you love just because you love 'em?
The Widow Tarwater druv past here a few minutes
agone, she that was Peachy Williams, and
though I ain't had more'n a bowin' acquaintance
with her fer nigh forty years, knowin' that the
Honourable Jones and our new Baptist preacher
the Rev. Elias Tupper, are both after her, I
kinder thought I'd like to see which one she
favours the most."</p>

<p>Then Ambrose went quickly inside his cottage
while Miner patiently waited on the outside,
understanding that this moment of withdrawal
to his own bedroom before finally leaving his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
home had become his friend's invariable custom
since the death of his second wife, Emily, five
years before.</p>

<p>In his bedroom the elderly man was standing
before his bureau, where to one side hung the
daguerreotype of a young woman.</p>

<p>"It's mortal queer, honey," he said aloud,
"how I ain't ever able to go places or to do
things 'thout expectin' you to come along, yet
there's times when it feels like you'd been gone
from me forever and then agen when it don't
seem more'n a few weeks."</p>

<p>He was afterward leaving the room with his
head bent and his eyes misty with tears when
suddenly a smile twitched the end of his nose
and the corners of his mouth lifted as he turned
once more toward his picture.</p>

<p>"Lord, Em'ly darlin', wouldn't you laugh if
three old codgers was to get into the race after
the widow instid of two? I would admire to see
them sure winners beaten by a dark horse!"</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Uncle Ambrose Thompson
as he was now called by almost everybody in
Pennyroyal, with every trace of lamentation removed
clean from his face, was walking toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the new red brick church, having Miner's arm
through his after their custom of more than
thirty years. Moses could no longer accompany
them, but was resting somewhat deeper under
the apple tree than had been his habit in life.</p>

<p>While in the course of their walk Miner never
once lifted his hat, Ambrose's was seldom allowed
to rest for a moment on his head, for
women of all ages smiled upon him and children
breaking away from grown up hands came to be
tossed in the air by his long arms. Uncle Ambrose
had grown very popular with the children
of Pennyroyal since the death of his and Emily's
only child twenty years before, since it was then
that he began bringing home to Emily for repairs
all the crying babies he could steal, the
boys who had stumped their toes and the girls
with torn frocks and feelings.</p>

<p>In the Sunday-school room he immediately
sailed up to the widow as gallantly as though his
ship had not failed to enter her port in nearly
forty years, and this when she was sheltered between
the law and the gospel. But before
Uncle Ambrose could speak a large soft hand
grasped his lean and vital one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Welcome!" said the minister with unction.</p>

<p>Three years before, the Rev. Elias Tupper
had entered Pennyroyal and with this same soft
hand had since patted and soothed his congregation
into following where their shepherd led.
Indeed, the building of the brick church had
been a tribute to his powers and to-night's
oyster supper a kind of harvest festival to celebrate
the last payment of the church's debt.</p>

<p>Nevertheless an unspoken antagonism had
always existed between the Reverend Tupper
and Ambrose Thompson, and indeed this was
the first appearance of the tall man within the
new church's domains.</p>

<p>Brother Tupper was a man of only medium
height, but of considerable breadth, with cheeks
as smooth and clean as a woman's. And while
his lips were thin and his eyes expressionless his
face managed to give the impression of a permanent
smile, the kind of smile that can come
from but one source, having nothing to do with
amusement over people or things, nor even contentment
in God's plan for His universe, but
manifests only a supreme and personal self-satisfaction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Now for the life of him Ambrose could not
refrain from frowning, because, while his lips
said, "Thank you," to himself he protested:
"I ain't able to bear it; this man actin' toward
me as though <i>he</i> was forgivin' me some mortal
sin every time we meet."</p>

<p>Neither was the widow's greeting of him cheering,
since forty years had not completely wiped
away a certain never-explained retreat.</p>

<p>The promised plenitude of Peachy Williams'
girlhood had been nobly fulfilled in the Widow
Tarwater, for now she suggested an abundant
harvest. A handsome black silk gown folded
over her more than ample bosom, a double chin
rippled from under the soft fulness of her broad
face, her skin was white and crimson as a child's,
her auburn hair without a thread of gray in it,
and her huge brown eyes never having looked
deep down into the waters of life showed none
of its troubled reflections.</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose nodded approvingly at her
appearance the while she looked at him coldly,
saying: "I ain't seen you to talk to in a long
time, Ambrose Thompson."</p>

<p>His reply flatteringly included the member of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the Kentucky legislature on the widow's right.
"'Course you ain't, Peachy," he answered gallantly,
"for when big stars is shinin' so close to a
planet, t'ain't to be expected that the planet kin
notice the little ones twitterin' about in her
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>And yet when supper was served the widow
found herself placed at a table for four whose
other occupants were three men instead of the
two whom she had expected.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ORIGINAL SIN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Widow Tarwater was in truth a pleasing
vision.</p>

<p>Not once had Ambrose Thompson left her
side, yet he had been uncommonly silent.
Thoughts, rose coloured as a boy's dream of a
holiday, were floating before his mind's eye; he
had been but dimly conscious that two plates of
warm soup had lately flowed into him the while
the conversation around him flowed on unceasingly.
For the spirit of romance, which is an
eternal though elusive thing, was surely taking
fresh hold on him this evening as his pillar of
cloud by day and of fire by night, and only Miner
Hobbs, the little wooden figure of a man seated
several tables off, was yet aware of his friend's
exalted state.</p>

<p>At the present moment the Rev. Elias Tupper
was talking to the widow. He had but lately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
traversed the room crowded with tables and resplendent
with decorations of harvest apples,
pumpkins, goldenrod and tall tasselled stalks of
corn, dispensing pleasantries as one would lollipops;
and now amid much joking, laughter, and
nudging had been allowed to take his place next
the widow, only the legislator, who was making
but a few weeks' visit in Pennyroyal, appearing
disquieted.</p>

<p>It was past seven o'clock and assuredly the
new Baptist Sunday-school room was now the
centre of Pennyroyal's social activities, when
unexpectedly the tall figure of a boy lurched
into the room&mdash;Pennyroyal's black sheep, a boy
taller than any man in the village save Ambrose
Thompson.</p>

<p>There was a dismayed flutter and then an uncomfortable
silence.</p>

<p>Now there are black sheep and black sheep
with extenuating circumstances, but this boy
had none of the extenuating circumstances&mdash;a
respectable family, money in the bank, or a line
of distinguished but self-indulgent ancestors;
no, he was simply a sandy-haired, loose-jointed
boy of about twenty-one who worked about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Widow Tarwater's stables&mdash;one of nature's curious
anomalies, a boy without a father.</p>

<p>He looked about the homely, cheerful company
at first with defiance, and then, feeling
the weight of his loneliness and degradation,
fell to crying foolishly. "I don't see why I ain't
a right to your church social; if I ain't no name
of my own, I got to be the son of some man in
this town!"</p>

<p>It was such a sudden, unlooked for accusation
piercing the holy covering of every hard-shelled
Baptist brother in the new Sunday-school room
that for the moment the little group of men were
staggered. Then while they were making up
their minds as to which one should have the
privilege of throwing out the intruder, a familiar
tall figure was seen crossing the floor, and putting
his arm about the lubbering, drunken boy.</p>

<p>"Come along, sonnie; steady now," he whispered,
leading him quickly away.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, sauntering back to the
church social, Uncle Ambrose found that supper
time was past and that the tables having
been cleared away there was more and more
room for conversation. Once again he sought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the Widow Tarwater's side, but this time was
received more graciously, for, putting out a
trembling hand, she clasped Uncle Ambrose's
with gratitude. "I'm obliged to you, Ambrose
Thompson," she said. "That boy's ever been
a thorn in my flesh. I have kept him at the
farm because my late husband was good to him,
but after to-night I don't feel called to have him
stay on."</p>

<p>The Rev. Elias Tupper's voice thereafter was
sufficiently loud to reach the ears of a number of
the members of his congregation who were
grouped about nearby.</p>

<p>"That boy," he announced, folding his short
arms across his chest and sighing deeply, "is a
painful example of original sin."</p>

<p>Since his return to the room up to this time
Uncle Ambrose had made no remark, but now
clearing his throat he eyed the last speaker for
so long in silence that a little clacking noise was
heard close by him and an old, old woman with
an ear trumpet held to her ear leaned so far out
of her wheeled chair that only her daughter's restraining
hand kept her from falling.</p>

<p>"Original sin, Brother Elias?" The tall man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
drawled his question thoughtfully. "I wonder
now why you speak of this boy's weaknesses
as <i>original</i> sin? I've done lived in Pennyrile
a right smart number of years and I ain't been
witness to a single original sin. Seems like
every fault a human crittur commits is just a
plain copy of some fault that has gone before
him. And I reckon it's more'n likely there's a
good many original sinners among us men here
to-night that has been original along pretty
much the same lines as this here boy."</p>

<p>There was an unspoken yet moving appeal in
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sympathic'">sympathetic</ins> tones of the well-known voice,
softening some of the women listeners and a few
of the men, but the Hon. Calvin Jones had still
to be heard from.</p>

<p>There are men in this world to whom even the
simplest exchange of words is a chance for oratory.
So the Honorable Calvin, frowning and
with one finger thrust in his coat, by his dramatic
silence held his audience for a moment
spellbound.</p>

<p>"May I inquire," he thundered, "if this lad
whom Mr. Ambrose Thompson has just rescued
and&mdash;er&mdash;defended, is any relation of his?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>In the interrogation itself there was no offence,
but to every grown-up person who heard, the
insinuation was plain enough.</p>

<p>To the tips of his big ears Uncle Ambrose
flushed. "No, sir, he's not my son," he answered
the man, who was a stranger to him before this
evening, "and maybe I'm glad and maybe I'm
sorry. For I won't say since my daughter and
Em'ly's died that I ain't thought most any kind
of a child's better than no child at all." He
hesitated and then went on in pretty much his
same old fashion of talking to himself: "Come to
think of it now, mebbe in a way this boy is a son
of mine, for I kind er think that every young
man that plays the fool is the son of every man
that's played the fool before him."</p>

<p>And then with a friendly smile he turned again
toward the widow.</p>

<p>"Ambrose," she faltered, with two round
tears rolling down her plump cheeks, "Brother
Elias and Mr. Jones advise against it, but maybe
you are thinkin' I ought to give that boy another
chance."</p>

<p>The tall man pressed the soft hand and shook
his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Peachy, I ain't never felt in my life that
I knowed what another person <i>ought</i> to do,
but ef I've studied 'em long enough and close
enough I know pretty well what they <i>will</i> do. I
took that boy home to spend the night with me,
but I'll be drivin' out to your place with him to-morrow
toward sundown. I'm more'n anxious
fer a little old-time chat with you."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ETERNAL FIRE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Uncle Ambrose</span> poured the grace of forgiveness
upon the pile of buckwheat cakes on his
guest's plate next morning in the form of an
over-supply of maple syrup, saying kindly:
"Eat well, sonnie; we ain't goin' to talk over the
events of last evening till you are feeling a little
stronger in the stomach."</p>

<p>And though the boy crimsoned and looked
sullen, he proved his recovery by his application
to the cakes.</p>

<p>"I was an awful fool last night," he mumbled
apologetically a few moments later.</p>

<p>"You were," Uncle Ambrose replied, "but
then being a young fool ain't so bad; it's bein' an
old one that's serious," and his faded blue eyes
twinkled self-accusingly, while the boy went on
talking into his plate.</p>

<p>"Course I didn't know what I was doin' when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
I bust into that social. Not that it matters;
nobody kires fer me about here, and I'll pretty
soon be clearin' out. The widow won't want
me back to the farm."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose leaned on his table, facing the
young man so squarely that the boy was obliged
to raise his bloodshot blue eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Nobody don't kire fer you in Pennyroyal?
That ain't the important thing; don't you kire
fer somebody, Sam? That's what keeps a man
straight. If we was stone images now set up in
a desert, why, we might hope to have people
come a-worshippin' of us, but bein's as we are
just ordinary&mdash;sometimes very ordinary&mdash;human
bein's, seems like we might do the lovin'
end ourselves." The older man searched the
face opposite him keenly. "How old are you?"
he inquired suddenly.</p>

<p>"'Bout twenty," was the answer. "I wasn't
more'n eight or ten when Farmer Tarwater
brought me to his farm and give me my schoolin'
till I was a good sized boy. He was more of a
friend to me than anybody's ever been."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose waved the last statement aside.
"Mebbe he was your friend and mebbe he wasn't,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
but the thing that worries me about you most,
Sam, ain't last night's scrape nor the rest of the
foolishnesses you been gettin' into in this village.
It's you settin' right here at my table and you
more'n twenty, been raised in Kentucky and got
eyes in your head, and yet tellin' me you don't
<i>kire</i> fer nobody! The Widow Tarwater told me
I could bring you back to the farm this evenin'
ef you was feelin' yourself, but mebbe you'd
better stay along with me 'till I kin kind of find
something to prop up under you."</p>

<p>But the boy's tanned face grew redder than
usual. "I didn't say I didn't kire fer no one; I
said there was no one kired fer me. There's a
girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now the tall man's hand struck the breakfast
table until the plates on it fairly danced.</p>

<p>"Glory, I knowed you'd more sense 'n you
showed!" he announced triumphantly, and coming
around to refill his visitor's plate put his arm
affectionately around his shoulder. "You got
the best thing on earth, boy, to keep you goin';
you got to learn a girl to love you." Uncle
Ambrose's emotional old face quivered with the
glory of the chase. "Course your girl don't kire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
fer you now, you ain't worth it, but you up and
show her what lovin' her has done fer you. And
mebbe I'll keep right 'longside of you, Sam."</p>

<p>This confidence was by no means finished, but
at this moment a thin, brown shadow, faithful
as the rising and setting of the sun, appearing at
the dining-room window, Uncle Ambrose's further
remarks were choked off. Returning from
the kitchen a moment later he put down more
cakes on the table and then shook his guest's
hand in farewell. "I got to leave you now fer
the day; Miner's come to git me to start fer the
store, but there's one thing I want you to recollect
while you're waitin' here fer me, sonnie, and
that's that the good Lord sends a new day once
in every twenty-four hours just to show folks
they kin begin agen."</p>

<p>It was a long day in the shop both to Miner
and Ambrose. Inevitably the little man had
grown more morose and bitter as the years went
by. For in spite of Emily's and Ambrose's
pleading he had gone but seldom to his old place
under the apple tree after their marriage, and
when his six sisters made homes of their own he
had lived entirely alone. Indeed old Moses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
had seemed the only companion he had ever
cared for except Ambrose, and on the day of Ambrose's
second marriage the dog had moved himself
and his allegiance from the tall man's house
to the little one's and had never gone home
again except to be buried.</p>

<p>Ambrose kept surreptitiously watching the
clock from the noon hour on until his partner
removed it clean out of sight in the back of the
shop: however, an hour before closing time Ambrose
began putting away his share of the stock,
remarking airily, "I thought I'd git away a little
sooner than usual this evenin', Miner, ef you
don't mind."</p>

<p>To this the little man at first returned nothing,
but seeing his friend step over to their assortment
of new neckties and laying aside his old
lavender one begin to match a bright red one
to the shade of his own complexion, he sighed.
"I reckon you feel it comin' on agen, Ambrose?"</p>

<p>Ambrose nodded. "It started last night at
the social," he replied truthfully, "and then
those other two men's actions kind er sicked me
on. Peachy has done ripened and sweetened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
considerable; mebbe you noticed it, Miner?" he
ended hopefully.</p>

<p>But Miner only scowled. "She's fat and old,
but t'aint nothin' to you, Ambrose Thompson,
once you're started. I was kind er hopin' you'd
be faithful to Em'ly."</p>

<p>However, in the midst of his reproach his
partner had vanished; nevertheless, ten minutes
later, he came back into the shop and seating
himself on the counter appeared lost in thought
for some little time.</p>

<p>"Miner," he confessed finally, "I am a-settin'
here tryin' to git a little light on the subject of
myself. I ain't feelin' unfaithful to Em'ly
'cause I'm noticin' the widow; I never felt unfaithful
to Sarah when I married Em'ly. I tell
you, Miner Hobbs, that what's workin' in me
now is that I ain't able to git old and give up
'thout makin' a fight. It ain't gray hair and
wrinkles that make folks hate gettin' old, it's
dryin' up, losin' their spark, so to speak. Now
there's nothin' that makes a man feel such an all
fired lot younger as fallin' in love over agen."
He laughed. "'Course I ain't recommendin'
dynamite, Miner, which is fallin' in love with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
new woman when you got an old one. That's
my way, 'cause fate's done sent it so fer me, and
we got to make our lives out of what we git.
But why can't a man just start in ever so often
fallin' in love agen and recourtin' his wife till he
gits himself and her all woke up as in the old
days? I ain't sayin' it's as easy with a stale girl
as with a fresh one, but, Lord!"&mdash;and here the
shadows chased each other across the luminous
elderly face&mdash;"I could 'a' kep' on courtin' Em'ly
till kingdom come and thanked God fer the
chance, ef He had but seen fit to spare her to me
so long."</p>

<p>And then Uncle Ambrose slipped off the counter
and went away and drove Sam out to the
Widow Tarwater's Red Farm, which was now
twice the size it had been in her youth, since
Peachy had married the young man owning the
place adjoining hers.</p>

<p>Yet somehow Uncle Ambrose's anticipated
visit proved a disappointment.</p>

<p>In the first place, both of his rivals were there
before him, and there was something in their
attitude and in the widow's manner that made
him hot with the desire to get the representatives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of the law and the gospel out behind a fence
and have everybody roll up their sleeves. However,
since no open accusations were made and a
woman was present, what was there for him to
do but to make a short stay and then return
slowly home?&mdash;home, to live through what was
perhaps the most extraordinary experience of
Ambrose Thompson's entire lifetime. For nearly
sixty years he had lived in the village of Pennyroyal,
been a friend to all its people, his life had
been there for them to see and interpret, and yet
with the first breathings of calumny the record
of his whole career was smirched. Still he made
no protest, for what does denial count if a man's
character cannot save him? His visits to the
widow were continued, however, and always he
found her in a flutter between affection and fear.
Nevertheless, Uncle Ambrose was merely biding
his time, but in the meanwhile Miner's silence
and devotion were more healing than any ointment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE REVIVAL SERVICE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ambrose</span> was raking the dead leaves in his
front yard two weeks after the oyster supper
when Susan Barrows summoned him across to
her with a wave of her ear trumpet. All day
she sat outdoors in her wheeled chair, huddled in
rugs, until the snow came, with her eager old
eyes fastened on the street, her curiosity hungry
after eighty years.</p>

<p>Ambrose knelt beside her with his lips to her
trumpet.</p>

<p>"They're sayin' ugly things about you," she
whispered. Then seeing the hurt in the man's
face that even Miner had not fully understood,
she rested her trembling hand on his gray head.
"Talkin' but not believin', Ambrose Thompson.
I ain't sayin' that some people don't agree to
this ugly story, since whatever's ugly naturally
pleases 'em, but the most of Pennyroyal is just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
rollin' this bit of scandal 'bout you under their
tongues like a sweet morsel and then spittin' it
out, knowin' it ain't fitten to swallow. But
what worries me is that I'm afeard you'll be
losin' the widow. Here's Brother Tupper
startin' in with a series of revival services to-night
at his new church, and the legislator neglectin'
the welfare of his State to keep close to
the widow! Not that it's the law I am so much
scared of as the preacher. Peachy's plump and
jelly-like and kin be easy shook, and I ain't been
a female eighty years 'thout knowin' how easy
'tis to work on our religious feelin's. You goin'
to the revivin'?"</p>

<p>Not at once did Uncle Ambrose reply; instead
he seemed to be considering.</p>

<p>"I'm not at all sure, Miss Susan; seems like
I've felt kind of lonesome in church since we lost
Brother Bills, but I've more'n half way promised
Peachy; she seemed so dead set on my attendin'."</p>

<p>Susan grinned. "Ef she's worryin' about you
needin' religious instruction, Ambrose, don't you
lose hope. It's a powerful wifely sign."</p>

<p>And so Uncle Ambrose went on back to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
work, vaguely comforted though not yet certain
whether or not to obey the widow's request. To
tell the truth, he had comparatively little faith
in his own chance with Peachy, since his befriending
the boy Sam had brought with it so
unfortunate a result. And yet the thought of
the possession of the Widow Tarwater had daily
grown more and more alluring as his rivals'
claims progressed, and she seemed so much less
ready for his picking than in past times.</p>

<p>Late that evening when the first of the present
series of revival services was in full swing, a tall
man cautiously entered an open door. He had
never yet been inside the church itself, and to-night
found it crowded to the doors with men
and even women standing in the aisles. Uncle
Ambrose felt annoyed, for having made a special
effort to be subservient he certainly desired that
the widow should know of it, and, moreover,
though he preferred not having the matter discussed,
frequent rheumatic twinges in his right
leg made standing for any length of time an
impossibility.</p>

<p>Now he shoved himself forward, politely edging
his way between saints and sinners alike,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
hoping that Mrs. Tarwater would at least get
a passing glimpse of him, when at the front of
the church, to his immense surprise, he discovered
an entirely empty pew.</p>

<p>There was no time for thought, and almost
immediately the newcomer dropped down upon
the seat, observing at the same instant that the
widow and her escort, the Honorable Calvin, were
in an opposite pew just across the aisle, though
why their pew should be so jammed and his own
exactly under the chancel entirely unoccupied
he did not then consider. Obeying his first impulse
Uncle Ambrose turned a smile upon the
widow. It was tremendously gratifying to observe
her large bosom heave with emotion, but
puzzling when soon after large tears coursed
down her quivering face.</p>

<p>Moreover, the persons in Uncle Ambrose's
immediate vicinity were also beginning to behave
queerly.</p>

<p>"The Lord be praised that one more sinner is
called to repentance!" he heard a sister's shrill
voice cry out just back of him, and then loud
"Amens" boomed all about. But even more
alarming&mdash;the Rev. Elias Tupper's expressionless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
eyes were apparently glued upon him, while
his face wore an exaggerated edition of that
smile of heavenly forgiveness so irritating to the
other man's soul.</p>

<p>With a shudder of horror it was now borne in
upon Uncle Ambrose Thompson that by misadventure
he had placed himself upon the mourners'
bench&mdash;the seat at revival services specially
set apart for sinners overcome with remorse who
desired to make open confession.</p>

<p>With a hunted look the unhappy man searched
about for some way of escape; there was none,
for the congregation had come crowding closer
toward the front of the church until every foot
of room was occupied.</p>

<p>Folding his arms across his lean chest and lifting
his head Uncle Ambrose waited. During
the first moments of his discovery his face had
grown extraordinarily red, but now was paler
than any man or woman had ever seen it before.</p>

<p>Lifting his right hand the Rev. Elias Tupper
commanded an intense and awed silence. "Ambrose
Thompson is before us to-night openly to
confess his sins," he announced in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Still the tall man did not move and not even a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
muscle of his set face pulsated. A moment of
waiting or longer must have gone by&mdash;nobody
could have guessed the exact passage of time&mdash;and
yet Uncle Ambrose appeared insensible.</p>

<p>The minister cleared his throat. "If Ambrose
Thompson is unable to speak for himself,
then I will do my best to speak for him."</p>

<p>But at this the presumably repentant sinner
rose up slowly, very slowly, almost it would
seem by inches, until he stood taller than any
other person in the new red brick church.</p>

<p>"It ain't my way to pray before a audience,"
he began quietly and with his gray head bowed,
although his words could be distinctly heard,
"and I don't know as I feel called to do any
special repentin' this evenin', seein' as I got up
on this here mourning bench by accident and
with no idea but to set and listen fer a while.
Still I reckon I got sins enough to be sorry 'bout
most any time the chance comes." Ambrose
then seemed to be reflecting for a moment, and
it is just possible that during this pause the thin
ghost of a smile played like heat lightning about
the end of his sensitive nose, although his expression
continued perfectly reverent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't be a mite surprised though,
Lord," he went on in almost a conversational
tone, "ef my neighbours wasn't better able to
confess my sins fer me than I am fer myself,
bein's as we've all got such special talents fer
our neighbours' motes. The trouble is I'm none
too sure one man can <i>precisely</i> understand another
man's, Heavenly Father, you've so many
and various ways of revealin' yourself to your
children. Course I know, Lord, I've loved fine
apparel too dear and smokin' and the outdoors
when mebbe I should 'a' been workin' in, and
mebbe I've laughed now and then over things
folks think should 'a' been cried over. And I've
had my hours of distrustin' and repinin' and forgettin'
it's God's privilege to run His world 'cordin'
to His idees, not mine. But, O Lord, what's
the use mentionin' things that ain't cheerful
even to you? I'm plumb sorry fer all I've done
that's bad 'thout goin' into further details."</p>

<p>And here again Uncle Ambrose paused; however,
not one of his strained and over-eager listeners
had any delusion that his prayer was
finished. He simply had been forgetting them
and now remembered. Then he lifted his head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and straightened his shoulders, and what he saw
through the shining oak ceiling of the new brick
church no one shall ever know.</p>

<p>"Ef any one here present is waitin' to hear me
say I'm sorry fer any lovin' I've ever done of man&mdash;or
woman (course I know you ain't expectin'
it, Lord)&mdash;then I am obleeged to state he or
she'll be disappointed. Women is the nearest
things I've known on this earth to the angels, and
I ain't been disobedient to the heavenly vision."</p>

<p>Up to this moment Uncle Ambrose's voice
had been low and evenly modulated, but now it
changed like the deeper tones of an organ until
it came to be the most wonderful music in the
world&mdash;a voice that was able perfectly to express
the richest things of the spirit. "But, Lord,
ef ever I'd wronged a woman, I'd not be askin'
forgiveness of you; I'd just ask that it be meted
out to me in like proportion as it has been meted
out to the woman, forever and ever. Amen."</p>

<p>And then not waiting for the closing of the service,
and forgetting his hat, Uncle Ambrose
passed on down the church aisle, where room
was instantly made for him, out into the white
stillness of the autumn night, away from calumny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and human irritation, and the little congregation
seeing him go with a look of added
dignity and peace, whatever their former ill-founded
suspicions, after to-night believed nothing
against him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INDIAN SUMMER</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Truth</span> is immortal, and one truth is that there
cannot be two pursuers in the game of love.</p>

<p>After the night of the first revival service
Uncle Ambrose, making no further visits to the
Red Farm, it was the woman who set herself to
lure him back again.</p>

<p>In the first place, he had by then convinced her
that her mistrust had been unjust and that she
had listened to suggestion that was not evidence.
So there was but one way by which the widow
felt she could make reparation and restore peace
between herself and Ambrose Thompson. She
must find out the name of Sam's father, for
necessarily the boy had to have two parents, and
the mother she had known as she had come frequently
to the farm on visits to her son up to the
time of her death.</p>

<p>The original informant mentioned in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Bible was a female: "And the damsel ran, and
told them of her mother's house these things."</p>

<p>Therefore after a certain period of effort the
boy Sam himself drove one afternoon into Pennyroyal
bearing three perfumed notes written by
the widow which he was to carefully deliver at
the post-office.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, along about four o'clock,
three men appearing in the village street at almost
the same time were seen to start off in the
direction of the Widow Tarwater's farm. Not
that they were together, certainly not; for some
little time they were even unconscious of each
other's destination. Ambrose, however, made the
discovery first, since owing to the enfeebled condition
of his livery-stable horse and the disabled
state of his prehistoric gig he was compelled to
be in the rear of the procession, which was headed
by the Honorable Calvin on a high black
charger and seconded by the Rev. Mr. Tupper
in a neat phaeton drawn by a fat pony.</p>

<p>The tall man could have vowed that the best
parlour at the Red Farm had not been changed
in more than three decades, except that a
criminal looking portrait done in crayons of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Widow Tarwater's late husband, who had been
an uncommonly handsome man, hung over the
mantel, for there in the same dark corner and on
the identical sofa sat Peachy, but a far more
flushed and emotional Peachy than her former
admirer recalled.</p>

<p>For indeed the widow's cheeks were burning,
her mouth tremulous like a worried child's, and
after her first greeting of her three visitors, she
continued twisting her handkerchief in and out
of her fingers, trying to speak and yet plainly
not finding courage. So conspicuously was she
needing consolation that Uncle Ambrose's long
arm fairly ached to accommodate its length to
her large waist, nevertheless the presence of his
rivals, who may or may not have been suffering
from the same pressure, deterred him.</p>

<p>"Ambrose," so much the widow did get out,
turning her eyes away from the encouragement
she might have received from the ardour of two
other glances, to rest them on her older friend,
"I feel it my duty, having lately acted kind of
suspicious to you, to tell you that I now know
who the boy Sam's father is, was&mdash;&mdash;" And
Peachy fell to sobbing now in such earnest that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
she was compelled to bury her flushed face in her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Two of the men stared; many hopeful things
had each of them anticipated in this hasty summons
from the widow, but not this confession.
However, the third man, hopping up, began
striding rather irritably about the room.</p>

<p>"If his father was, then fer the land sakes,
Peachy, keep it to yourself; 'taint a mortal bit
er use startin' things on a dead man."</p>

<p>But whether the widow belonged to the large
group of females with a passion for martyrdom
or whether she was less a martyr in telling her
secret than in keeping it, who shall say? For in
reply she shook her head, removing her handkerchief,
though permitting her tears to flow faster
than ever.</p>

<p>"My late husband was this boy Sam's father,"
she went on quickly, once she had fairly started.
"I might have guessed it years agone if I'd ever
thought on it; seems like I can recall now numbers
of times when he tried to tell me this himself,
and as he was so often askin' me to be kind
to Sam and give him a chance I more'n half took
a dislike to the lad. Lately I've been goin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
through some old papers and, well, there ain't
no more to be said 'ceptin' as I've no children
of my own I'm goin' to make this Sam my heir;
I've already writ out the papers."</p>

<p>With the ending of this speech Uncle Ambrose
enjoyed one of the most exquisite moments of
his later years. Not that he was so transfigured
by the proof of his own innocence, since the
annoyance that the scandal had caused had
passed that evening in church, and most certainly
not because he enjoyed hearing the reputation
of Peachy's former husband damaged, but
because the expressions on the faces of his rivals
proved what his wits had already discovered,
that the two men were not after the widow for
herself, but because of the abundance and fruitfulness
of her fields.</p>

<p>What the widow herself saw it was impossible
to tell, for almost immediately after, with her
face still buried in her handkerchief, she left the
room, and the three men could see her through
the window hurrying across the front lawn.</p>

<p>Left alone, the Honorable Calvin was the first
to speak. Drawing out a delicately scented white
handkerchief he wiped a slight dampness from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
about his lips. "I suppose the widow does not
fully understand this boy has no legal claim on
her," he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The minister sighed, waving a fat hand. "A
little remembrance, say a thousand dollars or so,
as a start in life would be quite sufficient."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose smiled. "I reckon you gentlemen
had better talk this matter over with
Mrs. Tarwater. Women have such foolish, softhearted
ways of tryin' to save the innocent and
help the guilty when they're able; 'taint law
and 'taint gospel, mebbe, but it's woman."</p>

<p>Then seeing that the legislator had risen to his
feet with the first understanding of his suggestion
the tall man laid a firm hand on him. "Better
let Brother Elias have the first show, Mr.
Jones," he drawled; "seems no more'n proper
respect to pay the gospel."</p>

<p>So both men waited ten minutes or more, the
Honorable Calvin glowering and fidgeting, while
Uncle Ambrose, whatever his inner stirrings, remained
imperturbably calm until, seeing a stout
figure returning to unhitch his pony, with his
face wearing an expression more of sorrow than
of anger, Mr. Jones waited for no further advice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Left alone, Uncle Ambrose betrayed his real
feelings. First, he looked at himself in a small
triple mirror on the mantel, carefully combing
with a little pocket comb the thin hairs well to
the front of his head over his increasing bald
spot, and afterward he walked restlessly about
the great room, finally arriving at the window.
It was always Calvin Jones he had feared.
"Good looks and a silver tongue! Lord, what
a combination!"</p>

<p>The sun was now going down at the edge of
the Kentucky landscape, in the fields the grain
had been cut and stacked and golden pumpkins
were lying between the piled up mounds of hay
and corn. Over the tips of the grass, which still
showed green, autumn leaves were swirling, and
hovering above, and through it all a fine, thin
mist which might be the coming blight of winter
or the lingering spirit of the summer's warmth.</p>

<p>Crossing a meadow and moving toward a big
red barn, Uncle Ambrose soon spied Sam driving
a long line of cows toward home. With a leap
his long legs carried him out the window and
swiftly across the yard. "Hullo!" he cried
while still some distance away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy's face reddened, but this time from
sheer pleasure. "Hullo!" he cried, all his sullenness
and resentment gone. And in a few moments
the older man's lean, strong fingers held
the boy's short stocky hand in a hard clasp. "I
am glad fer you clean through," he said simply.</p>

<p>The boy's head jerked toward the house.
"Has she told you?" he asked. "It's powerful
kind of her when she ain't even liked me."</p>

<p>"Kind?" Uncle Ambrose frowned. "Why,
boy, she's plumb magnificent!" And here he
curveted a few steps to the side. "Lord! ain't
it splendid&mdash;life so full of good things happenin'
every minute!" Stopping, he gazed steadily
and curiously into the eyes of the young man
near him, while the cows wondering at the delay
pressed their sweet smelling bodies against each
other and muzzled their soft noses. The boy's
eyes were no longer bloodshot nor ashamed.</p>

<p>"'Bout that other thing, sonnie, your girl?"
Uncle Ambrose hesitated. "Don't you tell me
nothin' ef you ain't a mind to. Lord! don't I
remember how a young fellow hates bein' pried
into."</p>

<p>"You ain't pryin'," the boy defended, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
it's comin' on great. I took your advice. I
just let myself do all the lovin' I could 'thout
stewin' over her feelin's fer me, and then all of a
sudden she up and told me she always had loved
me, only she was afeard I didn't kire fer her."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose's face shone. "A'ire you
worth her now, sonnie?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no," the boy answered; "but I kep'
straight since that night and I'll keep on. It's
lovin' that done it."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose raised his rusty stovepipe hat.
"Lovin', that's it," he answered.</p>

<p>And then across his wrinkled face there
marched a host of memories, while keeping his
eyes on the sky among whose soft clouds there
might easily have been floating any number of
angels, he repeated the toast made immortal
by Kentuckians: "The ladies, God bless 'em!"</p>

<p>Suddenly hearing the noise of a horse's hoofs
trotting away from the neighbourhood of the
farmhouse, Ambrose whirled, and before his
companion could guess what ailed him, started
running back across the lawn.</p>

<p>But this time Peachy was not to be so easily
found. Uncle Ambrose searched for her in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
yard and in the garden, in the place where the
old summer house, now a ruin, had once stood,
and then when the sun had disappeared and only
an afterglow remained, found her leaning over a
turnstile facing an orchard.</p>

<p>"I hope I ain't kept you waitin', Peachy," he
remarked, a trifle breathlessly.</p>

<p>The woman smiled and slipped her arm
through his that they might both lean together
on the turnstile. "Most forty years, Ambrose,"
she returned with a finer enjoyment than she
could have felt in her youth.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;You kin manage me now all you&#39;ve a mind to; I ain&#39;t worryin&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>And her sixty-year-old suitor blushed. "I
know more'n I did then, Peachy; I was frightened
of your managin' ways." He was feeling a considerable
anxiety, for the woman beside him was
like a piece of fruit, no longer in her summer
time, but reaching her perfection in late autumn.</p>

<p>Very quietly then Peachy withdrew her arm.</p>

<p>"I'm managin' now, Ambrose," she confessed.
"Seems like growin' old don't lose us our faults;
it kind er makes 'em set deeper. I should be
sorry to try you, but I'm some past fifty and
ain't able to change."</p>



<p>However, Uncle Ambrose simply put his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
arm around her, drawing her closer to him.
"Lord, Peachy, ef that's all, don't you fret.
You kin manage me now all you've a mind
to; I ain't worryin'. I was young and didn't
understand then that no man kin git on comfortable
in this world 'thout bein' managed
by a <i>good</i> woman." And he laughed and kissed
her with an ardour that was in its way as good a
thing as the springtime.</p>

<p>A minute later, the light dying quickly down,
the autumn moon rose up above the orchard, and
with the disappearance of the day the warmth
ended so abruptly that, with a little shiver, the
two middle-aged figures moved away, the woman
watching the man anxiously. "It ain't moonlight
we're needin', Ambrose Thompson," she
whispered; "I'm thinkin' it's the light of the
fireside."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"'LIZABETH"</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> old man leaned over, touching a cane-bottomed
rocking chair with his carpet slipper.
"Seems sort er more sociable like to see a little
female chair a-rockin'," he remarked to himself,
for the room was otherwise unoccupied, and even
the house itself.</p>

<p>It was a December night and snowing hard.
By and by the old man got up, and crossing over
to a side window where the blind had not yet
been pulled down, stood there for a moment
frowning and saying impatiently: "Ef that don't
beat all!" for mingling with the noises outside
there sounded a faint and monotonous crying.</p>

<p>He was an uncommonly tall old man with a
head like a highly polished billiard ball rising
above a fringe of thin white hair; he had a straggly
beard, while over his dim blue eyes the eyebrows
arched like cornices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally he shuffled back toward his place by
the kitchen fire, and there getting down the
family Bible commenced to read, first stuffing
both fingers in his ears, although every now and
then partially removing one to make observations.
He was reading the twenty-second chapter
of St. Matthew:</p>

<p>"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor
are given in marriage, but are as the angels of
God in heaven." However, on the third reading
he shut up his book, keeping three bunches of
pressed flowers inside to mark the place, and half
humorously and half with the irritability of old
age, sighed: "I don't feel as ef I could stand it a
inch longer. What mortal use is there in me
tryin' to make myself at all comfortable this
evenin' with that noise eternally pesterin' me?
Seems like it has always been my experience a
man has got to give in first <i>an'</i> last."</p>

<p>Then wrapped in the faded splendour of a once
gorgeous silk dressing-gown the old man disappeared
into his bedroom, returning with a
shawl crossed over his shoulders and a knitted
muffler tied about his head. On opening his
door he listened again for a moment, but, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the crying had not ceased, waded across his yard
through the snow in his carpet slippers until he
knocked with his big blue-veined old hand hard
against the locked back door of a cottage adjoining
his.</p>

<p>At first there was no answer except a continuing
of the sniffling, snuffling noises which only
made the visitor rap more vehemently, when at
length the door opened and there stood a woman
holding a lantern above her head.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ambrose Thompson, what kin you
want o' me this time o' night?" she asked; "it's
goin' on nine o'clock! You ain't sick?"</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose shook his head, surveying his
neighbour sympathetically, but oh, so disparagingly!
She was so plainly an old-time old maid,
flat in the chest and angular, a hard and bony
structure, with a face that was equally barren
save that its desert waste had lately been swept
by a storm.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't sick, child," Uncle Ambrose answered,
"but you are&mdash;heartsick. And what's
more it seems likely I can't stand that noise you
keep on a-makin'. You come over and set by
my kitchen fire a space and kind er talk things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
out with me. I reckon I ain't altogether lost
my soothin' powers!"</p>

<p>Before his glowing fire the old host comfortably
placed two rocking chairs side by side. For
the past seven years Ambrose Thompson had
been a widower for the third time and, since
Peachy's death, having come back home from
the Red Farm, had lived all alone in his once
rose-coloured cottage, looked after only by his
neighbours.</p>

<p>Picking up a crazy quilt cushion from his
chair, the old man surveyed it tenderly. "This
was my Em'ly's make," he explained; "seems,
'Lizabeth Horton, that you and me 're most
like strangers, havin' lived side by side only a
little piece like seven years. Em'ly she was the
second of my three wives." And then thoughtfully
passing his hand backward over his high
bald crown, Uncle Ambrose smiled in a kind of
slow and puzzled fashion.</p>

<p>"No, now I've done mixed things up a bit;
I'm gittin' a little oncertain these days. Em'ly
wasn't never the sewin' one," he continued,
"besides, this crazy quiltin' business was most
too new fashioned fer my Em'ly. I kin recollect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
now bringin' that sofy cushion in from the
farm, so it must 'a' been Peachy's. Funny
how I keep puttin' everything on to Em'ly
these days!"</p>

<p>Then seeing that his caller's red-rimmed eyes
had been yearning toward the coffee pot at the
back of his stove, the old man put it down before
her with a nicked but brightly flowered cup and
saucer, and afterward, settling himself in his
own place, peacefully began smoking, finding a
kind of unholy joy in the old maid's horrified
glances about his untidy but nobly littered
kitchen.</p>

<p>"S'pose you go ahead now 'n tell me just
what ails you?" Uncle Ambrose suggested after
a reasonably sustaining pause.</p>

<p>And straightway Elizabeth returned to the
slow and monotonous weeping that had so disturbed
his nerves for the past few hours. However,
he let her alone for a time, and except for
moving restlessly about in his chair and biting
hard on his pipe stem made no other signs until
at last he placed a trembling hand on her bowed
shoulder. "'Lizabeth Horton, there is some
women that just nachurally runs away to tears,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
but I wouldn't waste myself <i>en</i>tirely ef I was
you. Seems like when a female has cried 's long
as you have, she must need something to fill up
the places that has gone dry on the inside; so
you take another cup of coffee; it may be bitter
but it's liquid. I ain't sayin' I ain't used to
women's weepin', but I'm gittin' older an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elizabeth at this gulped down her second dose.
"I hadn't ought to cry so much, Uncle Ambrose,"
she apologized, "but you must know I'm havin'
to give up my little home and it most breaks my
heart."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose looked meditatively about
his ancient and patched fourteen-foot-square
kitchen, and his dim eyes shone with the never
failing pride of possession. "These cottages
ain't so bad," he said defensively. "I been living
in mine off'n on fer most seventy years, and
I kin remember when yours and old Mrs. Barrows',
now deceased, was built like it. Still I
am obleeged to say there may be finer places;
more'n likely now this nephew's house is stylisher
where you're bein' took in to live. Seems
like I've done heard it's in a su-burb and sets
up on a hill. Kind er onnecessary Pennyrile's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
havin' a su-burb, but mebbe you're thinkin' the
young folks won't be good to you when you go
up there to dwell."</p>

<p>Now that her crying had ceased the old maid's
face looked gray.</p>

<p>"It ain't that I ain't goin' to a good home,
Uncle Ambrose," she explained, "and I suppose
they'll be as good to me as they can to a piece of
furniture that don't fit in and ain't nowheres
needed in their house. I can't expect a man to
understand, but when a woman don't never
marry and hasn't a husband or children of her
own, seems like all she has to set store by is just
<i>things</i>, havin' a <i>home</i> of her own. I done my best
to keep mine since mother died and her pension
stopped, by picklin' and preservin', but somehow
I can't manage it." And now the woman's
voice held the quiet acceptance of defeat which
is sadder than any protest of tears.</p>

<p>She was looking into her lap at her knotted,
hardworking and yet unsuccessful hands as she
spoke, or else she would have seen the light of
the understanding she denied in the old face
opposite hers, which had not, I think, failed any
woman in nearly threescore years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've done smelt your efforts, 'Lizabeth,"
Uncle Ambrose murmured kindly. "They've
often come right through the boards of my side
wall. I wisht I knowed some way to help you
out, but I can't somehow see it."</p>

<p>Nevertheless when Elizabeth had made her
old neighbour as comfortable for the night as
she knew how by putting fresh coals on his fire
and by fastening down his windows, and had said
good night, still he continued sitting in the same
place, wearing a look of uncomfortable gravity,
until by and by hobbling once more into his bedroom
he returned with a small daguerreotype in
his hand and for a long while kept studying it,
with his lips moving silently, and then suddenly
said aloud: "Whatever on this earth am I
goin' to do 'bout that old maid, Em'ly honey?
She's poor and lonesome and she's scaired, and,
moreover, she's powerful homely." And then
just for an instant piercing the mists over his old
eyes the immortal light of laughter flickered.</p>

<p>"I reckon you think I've done earned a trifle
of repose from worryin' on females, don't you,
honey?" he inquired as he made his solitary way
toward bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"GIVING IN MARRIAGE"</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In a</span> similar cottage on one side of old Ambrose
Thompson, as has already been explained,
there now dwelt the single departing spinster,
Elizabeth Horton, whom Uncle Ambrose regarded
as a newcomer, her occupancy lying somewhat
within the period of twenty years, while on
the other side there still remained his youthful
enemy, Susan Barrows. Not Mrs. Susan Barrows,
Sr., because of course some years before
that old lady had been translated to that country
where we hope all human curiosity may be
satisfied, but her daughter, Susan Jr.; a little
prying, spiteful girl she would always remain to
Ambrose, although now a married woman past
middle age, with grown-up children of her own.</p>

<p>And among her other inheritances she claimed
an interfering interest in the old man's mode of
life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Now a set of signals having been arranged
between them in case of urgent need on his part,
at about six o'clock the next morning Susan was
aroused by a violent knocking on his wall on the
side of the house next hers, and hurrying over
she found the old man lying half dressed on his
bed and groaning with pain.</p>

<p>"Seems like I can't turn over or move or draw
long breath, Susan Jr.," he gasped. "'Course
I know I got my feet wet; 'tain't no use of you
startin' in on that. I've got the lumbago,
but bein's as I feel I mayn't be able to git up
fer a right smart spell you'd better step next
door and tell that old maid 'Lizabeth to come
over here and look after me. She ain't no kith
and kin to keep her busy like you."</p>

<p>Susan eyed her old neighbour narrowly; she
never had and never would be able wholly to
trust him, but now his fine old wrinkled face
seemed to be twisting with pain and his nose and
lips twitching.</p>

<p>"'Lizabeth can't come, you know it well as I
do, Ambrose Thompson," she replied. "I've
just got to do the best fer you I kin, though it
ain't noways convenient to me. This comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from you tryin' to live alone 'cause Aunt Ca'line
and the others who used to see to you is passed.
'Lizabeth Horton is movin' within a few hours,
bein' turned out of her house, bag and baggage,"
and there was such richness of superiority in
Susan Jr.'s voice, the kind of superiority which
the prosperous always feel in the presence of the
unprosperous, that the old man longed to shake
her.</p>

<p>But instead he only remarked with suspicious
meekness: "'Lizabeth's furniture is bein' moved,
Susan Jr., but not necessar'ly 'Lizabeth; leastways
I don't believe she is engaged to go off in
the movin' van settin' on top her best dresser
like a hen, though it's what a lot of women would
like, they're so bound up in things mortal."
And then Uncle Ambrose fixing his gaze on a far
spot in the ceiling shivered and groaned until his
audience hurried away, when he was able to
relax into greater comfort.</p>

<p>Thus it was that 'Lizabeth took up the business
of caring for Uncle Ambrose Thompson
until such time as the lumbago should depart
from his back.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>

<span class="caption">&quot;Thus it was that &#39;Lizabeth took up the business of caring for Uncle Ambrose Thompson&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>From the first the old man could see that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
spinster was enjoying herself thoroughly; true,
his cottage was small, but then it was exactly
like her own save that he had let his grow truly
magnificent in its dirt and disorder, being not of
the type of male with perverted feminine instincts,
while Elizabeth never had had but one
womanly passion gratified and that was her love
of putting a house to rights.</p>

<p>So for some little time Uncle Ambrose rather
found pleasure in staying in bed with the hateful
burden of solitariness removed from him; he
loved listening to the familiar homely sounds of
sweeping and the moving about of furniture; it
brought back&mdash;ah well, perhaps at seventy-six
it is something to have many things to remember.</p>

<p>And then, lying alone, he used to talk very
often to his picture of Emily, which still hung on
its nail by the old pine bureau, for this habit,
begun after her death and only practised in secret
during his marriage to Peachy, had grown
on him in these last seven years of failing body
and mind.</p>

<p>"She's a real good woman, Em'ly," he said
several times, "and you'll be glad to know she's
makin' me more comfortable than I been in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
time. I was gittin' pretty tired. Seems like I
might as well let this old spinster stay on here
and keep house fer me; she plumb likes it and I
reckon it's just one little thing more I kin do fer
the sex. I ain't much good at lonin' it, and
'tain't like I had old Miner now fer the in betweens."
And then he would laugh silently
until the wrinkles in his old face seemed little
channels for merriment: "I been married so
frequent and got broke in to so many different
sets of housekeepin' ways, seems like I ain't
troubled to form no ways of my own."</p>

<p>And in between dozing and talking to himself
and the neighbours, who ran in to inquire for his
health, Uncle Ambrose used to spend some time
in reading his Bible. One afternoon when
Elizabeth had been sitting by his bedside sewing
and thinking him asleep, he suddenly rose up in
bed as though completely ignoring the pain in
his back and drawing his old Bible across the
coverlid opened it again at the place of the
pressed flowers.</p>

<p>"'Lizabeth," he asked after a moment of uncommon
gravity in which his hand frequently
glided over his bald crown, "are you a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Bible woman? I mean are you a good interpreter
of the Scriptures? Seems like I didn't
used to look to others fer the meanin' in things,
but I'm gittin' a leetle mite older and folks is
pretty apt to confuse wishes with facts&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Elizabeth's austere face, with its rigid
regard for set duties, was reddening. "I read
my chapter every night and I try to live accordin',"
she answered.</p>

<p>Then into Uncle Ambrose's old voice there
crept such an eagerness it might have held the
warm desire of youth: "Mebbe you kin tell me
then&mdash;the meanin' of this here Bible text. I
ain't never regarded it for seventy years, but I
been worryin' over it consider'ble of late, and
now I'd like to get a woman's views on it."
And with his trembling forefinger following the
lines he had read to himself on the evening before
Elizabeth's installation he said: "It is
what Jesus remarked to the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Sadduces'">Sadducees</ins>: 'For in
the resurrection they neither marry nor are
given in marriage, but are as the angels of God
in heaven.'" And here Uncle Ambrose's eyes
travelled wistfully toward the faded daguerreotype
on his side wall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally his listener was puzzled, but afterward
laughed a laugh with a touch of new humour
in it. "Lord! Uncle Ambrose, I <i>am</i>
sorry," she apologized, "but I ain't had cause to
worry over that text same as you have; bein's
as I'm turned fifty now and ain't had so much as
<i>one</i> husband on this earth, I'm kind of expectin'
to carry my same single blessedness along with
me on the t'other side."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose's eyes twinkled appreciatively,
but a moment later he looked uncomfortable
again. "Well, I reckon that's reasonable
of you, 'Lizabeth," he agreed. "Folks can't
understand things fer other folks; there's plenty
can't comprehend me marryin' so often and
now worryin' over arrangements for the future.
But it's like this, child: a man may git a
lot of <i>help</i>mates in this world, but he don't find
his <i>real</i> mate but once. And I want to know
which one of my three wives is goin' to claim me
in heaven, 'cause it looks like that combination's
got to be eternal. To tell you the truth, I was
so worried lately I sent fer the latest Baptist
preacher and put this question up to him, and
all he did was to read this selfsame verse out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
St. Matthew as though I hadn't read and studied
over it more'n a hundred times. The new
brother seemed to think we'd have to travel
alone up in heaven 'thout playin' favrits, but I
can't come to agree with him. To tell you the
truth, 'Lizabeth"&mdash;and here Uncle Ambrose's
words sunk to a hoarse whisper&mdash;"ef the facts
be known I want my Em'ly. I done my best
without her, but it wasn't <i>whole</i> livin' 'cept when
I had her, and I ain't meanin' nothin' in disfavour
of no one else. Of course ef it's true that
the Lord don't believe in marriages in the next
world, with me such a marrier in this, then that
text 'll be a whole lot of assistance to me in gittin'
things fixed. For when my three wives
come a-floatin' up to me as the angels are, I'll be
more'n pleased to see 'em <i>all</i>, but I got to speak
up pretty positive: 'I want my Em'ly, and there
ain't no marriages nor givin' in marriage in
heaven.' For you see I marries little Sarah
first and that might give her the first claim, and
Peachy last, so it's likely she might think a last
tie would bind. Seems like it wouldn't look
regular to have the three of 'em to once." And
at this the speaker smiled with a kind of appreciative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
vision of things to come, while at the
same time wiping his brow, which was gleaming
with perspiration.</p>

<p>A day or so after this, having suddenly found
his confinement unendurable, Uncle Ambrose
demanded to be taken outdoors, and so wrapping
him carefully in blankets Elizabeth set him
out on the back stoop to look over his little snow-covered
yard, leaving the door open that she
might hear if he called to her.</p>

<p>And the woman was so happy now that she
sang as she went about her work, for in moving
him out the old man had asked her to stay and
keep house for him so long as he should live.</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose did not observe Susan Jr.'s
birdlike black eyes peer slantingly at him
through her partially closed blind, for two lady
sparrows who had chosen to perch on the same
twig were keeping up such a violent discussion of
their territorial rights that they held his amused
attention, so that Susan was able quietly to slip
out through her front door and into his by a
surreptitious move that outflanked her enemy.
But pretty soon the old man caught the notes
of her ever meddlesome voice and then a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
later the sound of monotonous weeping. He had
heard Elizabeth Horton crying one evening for
two mortal hours and so was not apt to mistake
her particular sniff. At first he squirmed restlessly
in his chair, attempting to rise, but both
the blankets and his reputation as an invalid
enveloped him so that finally he called sharply:
"Susan Jr., Susan, don't pretend you don't hear
me. Come right out here on my stoop, I got to
speak to you alone."</p>

<p>And Susan crept stealthily out. She had
grown up to be a thin, small woman with a meddlesome
soul out of all proportion to her body,
and now she wore a wheedling smile such as one
might employ with a fretful baby.</p>

<p>"You are lookin' right smart better, Uncle
Ambrose," she began, "and 'Lizabeth Horton
tells me you'll soon be yourself again."</p>

<p>"Susan," the old man interrupted, "you are
in that kitchen hatching up trouble fer me sure
as sin. I heard you tellin' 'Lizabeth that she
oughtn't to be stayin' much longer with me.
What did you do that fer?" And Uncle Ambrose's
eyes, which could be like points of steel
in righteous anger, now emitted certain fiery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sparks. "'Lizabeth is happy and is makin' me
comfortable after seven more lonesome years,
and you've always been preachin' I ought to git
some one to take kire of me. Susan Jr., the
Lord gives and the Lord taketh away, but don't
you try comin' around here playin' the part of
the Lord. You let this spinster be."</p>

<p>Again Susan Jr. smiled with an air of superior
virtue. "It ain't <i>me</i> that's talkin', Uncle Ambrose;
I ain't seein' anything so wrong in your
present relations, but I must say folks in Pennyrile
is beginnin' to speculate some, bein's as
'Lizabeth is just turned fifty and you with such
a reckernized taste fer female folks, why, though
things ain't to say scanderlous, there is some
that thinks 'em a little pe-cul-iar."</p>

<p>"Go, Susan," and though Uncle Ambrose
spoke with restraint his long finger pointed toward
the intervening space which lay between
his house and hers. "Go, afore I'm able to tell
you what I think of you, 'cause I've known you
from a child and you ain't changed none&mdash;fer
the better. To think of you sneakin' over here
fer the supreme pleasure of worryin' one poor
homely old maid with your gossip and suggestin's."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
And Uncle Ambrose's face worked with
the annoyance of frustrated old age. "Ef only
'Lizabeth had had one or two husbands she
wouldn't be payin' no attention to this, but
bein's as she's never had none, well, I kin see
that I'm goin' to have my hands pretty nigh full.
Seems like I'd rather turn a child out 'n the world
than this poor unrequited female."</p>

<p>Late that evening Elizabeth gave Uncle Ambrose
his supper as usual, although her eyes were
so nearly closed from weeping that she was unable
to catch the worried gleam in his. However,
before going to bed she told him that she
would have to leave him and go to her nephew's
as soon as he was well enough to be about again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"I SHALL WANT MY EM'LY."</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On that</span> same night Uncle Ambrose suffered
a relapse and remained in bed for another week;
however, he had already got sufficiently rested
from his previous laying up and, besides, even at
seventy-six he had not yet come to evading an
issue. He was merely taking time to think.</p>

<p>One evening just as the lamps in his room
were being lighted he called Elizabeth to his bed.
"I'm goin' to git up to-morrow, 'Lizabeth, and
stay up; I'm 'bout as well now as I'm ever goin'
to be, seein' as I'm gittin' older each day 'stid of
younger," he said with the gentle firmness that
had always come to him in big moments.</p>

<p>With a nervous trembling Elizabeth smoothed
the old man's pillows, tucking his blankets in
more closely about him. "I'm reel glad fer you,
Uncle Ambrose; then you won't be needin' me
much longer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old man shook his head. "Set down,
'Lizabeth, I want to talk to you; I don't want
my supper, leastways not yet."</p>

<p>But when Elizabeth had seated herself by the
side of his bed for a time he continued silent
while his glance wandered from the spot where
his daguerreotype hung alongside the wall to the
figure of the elderly worried spinster, and once
catching a reflection of himself in the looking
glass with a night cap tied under his chin and
then a vision of Elizabeth, suddenly his blue eyes
under their overhanging brows brimmed over.</p>

<p>"'Lizabeth," he inquired at length, "did I
ever show you the picture of my Em'ly?"</p>

<p>"You ain't exactly showed it to me," she replied
kindly, "but I been seein' it every day
when I come in here to clean; she's got a kind of
different face; it's a pity she had to leave you."</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose only cleared his throat a trifle
more huskily. "You're a good woman, too,
'Lizabeth, and so was little Sarah and Peachy
Tarwater, and you're makin' my declinin' days
peacefuller, givin' me a chance to relish things
that is past, and to hope fer things to come. Not
that I kin say you're one mortal bit like Em'ly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
cause you ain't, but all women 'a' got different
ways, fer which the Lord be praised. I been
lyin' here thinkin' a darn sight lately; ain't had
much else to do." But if Uncle Ambrose expected
a look of understanding in his companion's
face at this he was disappointed. "I know
I got to vacate this earthly tenement pretty
soon, and though I've had good times and sorry
in the building I ain't objectin' to quit. Seems
like a new dwellin' house 'll give us more light
and space. It's many times I've wondered ef
mebbe the spirits of them that love us ain't always
hoverin' close, ef only we had the right
kind of windows to look out at 'em with. Why,
child, there's certainly been times when I've felt
my Em'ly's arms a-holdin' me up and her wings
brushin' my face. She's done been helpin' me
about you lately; 'cause you see I know she'd
always want me to do anything that'd make me
comfortable and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Elizabeth was not listening to the old
man's soliloquy. She was thinking of herself,
trying to tear out the tendrils that had grown
so close about Uncle Ambrose's house, which
had lately come to seem so like her own. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
finally when she could bear the pain no longer
she rose and started stumbling from the room.</p>

<p>Uncle Ambrose called out after her. "Don't
go, 'Lizabeth, and don't try to stop cryin'.
Tears is nachural to some women and you sure
are one of 'em. I ought to be used to 'em by
now. 'Lizabeth, I don't want you to leave me;
I want you to stay by me till my trumpet
sounds." Elizabeth shook her head.</p>

<p>"Think you got to go 'cause of what Susan
Jr. said?" Uncle Ambrose's long nose twitched
between amusement and scorn. "Good Lord!
why is it the good women that is so afeard of
talk?" he muttered to himself. "But thinkin'
it all out kireful, 'Lizabeth, I ain't able to let
you go. I can't stan' livin' 'thout female aid,
and there ain't no use me tryin'. So now you
listen to me. When I'm out o' this bed, and
it'll be to-morrow, do you think you could
bring yourself to marry me?" Uncle Ambrose
laughed. "Don't git scaired, child; ef you ain't
heard them words before it ain't the first time
I've said 'em. But don't you answer me too
quick; think it over and when you come back
after fixin' my supper 's time enough, for I ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
yet told you all I been steddyin' over, believin'
the rest 'd come in better later on."</p>

<p>Then while Elizabeth was away this lover of
many women lay with his dim old eyes still
steadfast upon the picture of her who after all
was "the only woman." "You feel I'm doin'
what's best, don't you, honey?" he said with the
completeness of a perfect union. "She's poor
and lonesome and homely, but I've worked it
out so it'll be all right."</p>

<p>Afterward, when Uncle Ambrose discovered
that his supper tray held all the dishes he most
liked, he did not let his expression betray him,
but ate his well-cooked meal peaceably and enjoyably
until Elizabeth came to take away his
tray, when his feeble hand caught hold of her
hard one, trying to give it the rightful pressure.</p>

<p>"I can't," the old maid answered sorrowfully;
"it's only because you are sorry for me."</p>

<p>And Uncle Ambrose hesitated. To tell any
woman he did not love her, here at the end of his
seventy-six years! "I'm growin' powerful fond
of you, 'Lizabeth Horton," he hedged, "but ef
I'm sorry too, what's the odds? I reckon I'm
sorry fer myself and been sorry fer most everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
I've knowed in this world one time or another.
But mebbe you kin see things better like
this. I'm more'n anxious fer you to look after
me till I die and keep me from gittin' too darned
lonesome and, moreover, I want to leave you
this here cottage when I go away. See here,
'Lizabeth, I've done had some experience with
women and I've been thinkin' a lot on what you
said to me that evenin' you come over here to
dry your tears. I kin see there are some women
who kin live 'thout husbands and some that's
just got to live 'thout children, but there's some
women that ain't able to live 'thout homes of
their own. Why, you poor old 'Lizabeth, you'd
just pine away and die ef the time ever come
when you didn't have a house to keep: it would
be worse 'n food starvin', 'cause it would last
longer. I ain't no children of my own"&mdash;and
even now Uncle Ambrose winced at saying it&mdash;"and
what with selling my interest in the store
when Miner went and a remembrance from
Peachy I got a tidy sum of money in the bank.
So I've got no special call to leave my money to
nobody, but I know Pennyrile, and she sure
would make it warm fer you ef I willed you my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
property 'thout makin' you my wife. Give me
my answer, 'Lizabeth; I ain't tryin' to bribe you,
though I want you to stay by me, but I'm gittin'
kind er tired and I ain't said all I've got to say
yet."</p>

<p>And here Uncle Ambrose turned his eyes for
another time toward Emily's picture with their
familiar appeal for light in dark places.</p>

<p>"There is one more request I'm bound to
make, but it ain't goin' to hurt you or any female
to be sensible."</p>

<p>"Uncle Ambrose," the old maid faltered, her
yellow cheeks flushing palely, "ef you're sure
you want to marry me I shall be plumb glad. I
like to stay here and take care of you, and I
don't want to leave you or this house. I'll try
my best to do my part."</p>

<p>"Then you listen to me," said the old man,
speaking like a grown-up person to a confused
child, "and you remember I don't want to hurt
your feelin's, but whatsomever cometh I've got
to git this out of me."</p>

<p>"What is it, Uncle Ambrose?" Elizabeth inquired
anxiously. "I told you I was hopeful to
do my part."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Before replying the old face set into beautiful
lines of dignity and untarnished faith. "Do
you recollect, 'Lizabeth, I told you once that
when I died and crossed over the Jerden I was
hopin' to spend the life eternal with Em'ly.
T'ain't nothin' against little Sarah or Peachy,
but you see I married Sarah 'fore I'd met up
with Em'ly, and then Peachy she'd kind er
staked out an original claim. It won't matter
nothin' to Em'ly, but ef the truth be known I
ain't no ways easy in my mind 'bout that Bible
text I was a-repeatin' over to you. It may
be I ain't got the Lord's meanin' exactly clear,
whether the marriages made on this earth are
goin' to hold good in heaven, so you kin surely
see, 'Lizabeth, that there ain't no use in me
addin' complications to the future at my time of
life."</p>

<p>And here reaching under his pillow Uncle
Ambrose drew forth a crumpled sheet of paper
torn from a book which deeded his cottage to
Elizabeth Horton and five thousand dollars in
bank in the event of her becoming his wife.</p>

<p>"I know this document ain't legal," he explained,
"but I'll have it writ out fair and square<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by a lawyer and sign it soon as ever I can ef
you'll only give me a little slip of paper in return
with a few easy words written on it."</p>

<p>The woman waited a moment puzzled. "I
don't quite understand you, Uncle Ambrose,"
she returned.</p>

<p>"No, of course you don't, child. I just want
to know ef you feel willin' to write down these
here words: 'I, Elizabeth Horton, bein' fourth
wife to Ambrose Thompson, do hereby relinquish
all claim to him come the time when I shall meet
him in heaven.' You see how 'tis, 'Lizabeth,"
Uncle Ambrose argued wistfully. "I wisht I'd
thought to make some such plan with Peachy
'fore she died; not that I'm at all certain she'd 'a'
done it," he added truthfully, "but it would 'a'
eased my mind consid'ble in these last childish
days ef I only had little gentle Sarah to explain
things to on the other side. I don't want there
should be any argufyin' or confusion just when
Em'ly and me are tryin' to git off quiet to ourselves
and talk things over."</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not answer at once, for her vision
did not naturally travel beyond the confines
of this world, but other women before this old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
maid had travelled far in this now old man's
leading. So she did not feel his request to be
either childish or unreasonable, only she too
wanted time to think. For after a while with
her eyes resting affectionately upon the old face
now lying so quiet on the pillow, and at the still
beautiful and once so strong hands clasped together
outside the counterpane, she leaned over
toward him and whispered.</p>

<p>"I'll give you that paper you want, Uncle
Ambrose, and I'll write on it same as you wish
me to, for I shall have the home, and somehow I
feel it will be only right that you and Em'ly
should have each other."</p>

<p>"Amen!" whispered Uncle Ambrose.</p>
